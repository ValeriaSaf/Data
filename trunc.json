        "reviewText": "In fairness, the strings themselves are functionally fine.  AND I put them on a 7/8ths (GS Mini) guitar which, by the very nature of its scale length, has lower tension to begin with.  So the 3 starts is more about the entire picture, not the strings in isolation.  But that's fair - strings in isolation don't produce music.\n\nHere's the rub: these are lower tension strings, right?  So your truss rod has to do less work, right?  I lost quite a bit of neck relief (actually, all of it) when installing these strings.  It took about 3/4 a turn (which is a lot on a truss rod) to get back to .007\" relief.\n\nNow my intonation is slightly off (which makes no sense given how little neck relief I have).  Before these strings I had everything on this guitar dialed-in.  I could capo at the 5th with no pitch issues.\n\nBut hey, maybe I stink as a luthier.  Maybe your guitar is better.  I don't know.  I just know I wish I'd never installed these strings.  I'll go back to the OEM Elixirs the next time I place an Amazon order.  But since I went through all this trouble I'll play them for a while.  Why not?\n\nTone, playability, quality... it's all good.  It's just not as significant as expected.  In fact, the only significant difference was how the strings didn't pop out and attack you when released from the bondage of their packaging.  I kinda' missed the booby-trapped violence of opening guitar strings.\n\nI think it's your playing a full scale robust instrument with high-ish action that needs some taming (like a big 'ole full scale jumbo) then definitely give these a shot.  Just order a set of regular strings too in case your guitar gets whacked out of shape.  Or call your buddy who knows how to set-up a guitar and buy him/her a 6 pack."

Sure, my equipment is not exactly high-end, but I must say I had maybe expected a bigger difference to the sound -- that warm tube sound that everybody is talking about, and I can't say it made a big difference on my setup. Perhaps the preamps in the mixer and in the recorder are not to bad after all... It may be more useful as a direct box if you need it. It is also very noisy, with a lot of hiss if you turn up the gain a little. On the positive side, it looks very nice and seems well built, although the LED-lit vacuum tube is gimmicky and makes me wonder if the tube is really operating at all. The phantom power is also useful, but all in all I am pretty underwhelmed."

I stored the mic cables in an open cardboard box for a few months before using them, and that seemed to help a lot with the rubber smell.

That's right-- if you want to power this from an outlet rather than USB, you must order the adapter separately.\n\nLet me explain some technology basics. There are two ways to \"interface\" a MIDI controller with your computer.\n\n1) USB. This sends power and MIDI data down a single cable. It is high-latency (meaning it adds several fractions of a second to the keyboard input) and requires software to correct for this. This correction is pretty effective and most hobbyist users may not notice this latency.\n\n2) A MIDI cable. This sends data over a type of data cable that has been around since the 1980s. This data cable has zero latency. It also requires that the keyboard be powered by a wall adapter.\n\nFor $200, it is fair to expect both options #1 and #2 out-of-the-box.\n\nFew music professionals who depend on MIDI for a mission-critical application would use option #1. If you control instruments in a pro studio environment, you can notice the MIDI latency issues of USB. If you control instruments live environment in front of 100 or 30,000 people, you want separate power and data cables for trouble-shooting. Either way, professionals mostly go with option #2.\n\nSo forgive me if I purchased this with the expectations of a serious music professional. If I was a hobbyist (who did not have a tremendous amount of other gear sitting around) -- and I just wanted a quick and adequate MIDI controller to plug into my MacBook -- I might give this 5 stars.\n\nUnfortunately, I bought this expecting to quickly get going in a professional studio environment using methods that have been industry-standard for almost 30 years. I was stopped dead in my tracks by the lack of a power adapter.\n\nI would give this zero stars with no apology. M-Audio needs to take professionals seriously. Shave 50 cents off the profit margin and include an AC adapter with this keyboard. It has been a royal waste of my time and slap in my face. Time is money -- In the time it takes me to re-box and return this, I could easily have made the extra money it would have cost to include an AC adapter."

Sometimes, when a person is looking for a punchy bass sound they end up sounding piercing.  I never had any fret buzz or problems with the hardware.  This guitar looks very close to its Gibson counterpart, though they differ, mainly in the fact that the Epiphone has a bolt-on neck.\n\nDespite having the widely considered inferior bolt-on, this bass has some great sustain.  In fact, my only complaints about the insturment were that it was awkward to play while sitting down.  It wasn't THAT bad, for those of you who've played a \"V\" sitting down, but it did take getting used to.  My only \"real\" complaint then is, as another reviewer stated, the guitar is head-heavy and will tip down a bit if you let go of the neck momentarily.  Once my neck swung down and smaked the floor!

Besides, it won't look this good.\n\nI've purchased three pop filters thus far in the last four months.  The most recent one I purchased was NOT this one.  I wish it was.  I thought I'd try something different, just to see the differences.  Well, I can tell you that there are significant differences between this, and some of the others featured here.\n\nThe bottom clamp on this one features a rubber piece that grips the metal pole that you attach to.  The competitors that I've tried do not.  If you do not have this rubber piece, any clamp will tend to slip down the pole and not grip properly.  This is a huge mistake as this makes using a pop filter on a boom stand impossible.  Fortunately, Nady placed this rubber piece on it's clamp so this has never been an issue.\n\nThe only complaint I have is the screen has actually popped out of the plastic ring a couple times.  A single dot of superglue fixed that.\n\nCompared to the other pop filters I've seen and used, this one is perfectly suited for any microphone and at a reasonable price you can't beat it.\n\nAnd yes, pop filters ARE A MUST with condenser microphones.  Just buy one now, save yourself the trouble."

The plastic screw (yes, plastic) that is meant to grip the pole that you attach the pop filter to, is completely incapable of supporting it's own weight at nearly any angle.  Bad...just bad.\n\nSecondly, there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp.  It seemed loose after I got it out of the packaging and the flex arm would wobble and rotate in that spot causing a major problem when it came to proper placement.  After twisting on it twice I stripped it out.  Now the thing is worthless.  I'm returning it ASAP.\n\nI would rather go to a lady's bag flea market sale with a crazy woman for a day than continue to put up with this thing.  Do yourself a huge favor and buy the Nady 6\" pop filter.  If you don't, you'll wish you did."

Today I took my Taylor 416 CE Spring Limited in to where I bought it look at a slight issue; when I bought it the first thing I did was put on my favourite strings, D'Addario phosphor Bronze 12's. The store owner, who sold me the guitar a year ago, suggested we try the factory spec strings (Elixir Nanoweb 13's) to see if anything resolved. (it didn't). Took my guitar home, kind of hoping I could like the Elixirs, and played a few hours- the salesman said they'd changed the coating since the last time I tried them many years ago. I have to say, the same issues I always felt about these strings are there. I just hate the feeling of these strings under my fingers- feel like they have Finger Ease on them and are too slick. And more importantly, I hate the tone. There is something missing- that breathy 'zing' on the top end of a fresh set of good quality uncoated strings. Who cares if they 'last longer' if the overall tone is inferior to begin with? I can change my strings more often to have what I like, thank you. I feel Elixirs are a pricey gimmick, used to keep showroom guitars holding tone a bit longer and to placate people who are too lazy to change strings regularly. Tomorrow out come the needle-nose pliers and back to D'Addarios for me. Never again."

Fender's marketing dept. was right on in bringing back this classic.  Too bad they dropped the ball.  The two I have played through sounded nothing like the original Super Reverb.  One of them was falling apart in the store!  The other was at a recording session.  I used it for all of ten minutes before switching to another amp.  I couldn't say whether or not the electrical circuit has been accurately replicated, but I do know the one huge difference between this \"reissue\" and an original.  The original Super Reverbs were hand-wired, and hand-soldered.  These are constructed using printed-circuit boards and 'wave' soldering.  Any amp guru will tell you that there is a huge difference, and there are some of these guys that charge $600+ to hand re-wire \"reissue\" amps to vintage specs using the point-to-point method.  Fender does build many fine amplifiers and they are presently building some \"Custom Shop\" amps that are hand-wired replicas and sound tremendous.  The prices are justifiably higher for the labor involved.  It's a shame they didn't elect to include this classic in that catalogue."

        "reviewText": "I purchased this for an Epiphone Les Paul Standard. The guitar fits snug in the case and is well padded. The reasons I give it less than a stellar star rating relate to two issues.\n\nFirst, a fairly large bump on the top of the case; something stuck on the case's shell which was covered by the outer skin.  Admittedly, it's going to get scuffed up and a bump isn't going to matter, but new out of the box, it wasn't what I wanted to see. A second issue relates to the latches; three of the four have a good firm latch, but the fourth is almost too loose to close properly - this is without a guitar inside the case.\n\nThe case also has a very strong 'plastic' odor in the interior. Not a big issue I guess as guitars don't really pick up odors, but it doesn't dissipate quickly. Even when left to air (open) for 24 hours, the odor was still very strong.\n\nReading through a few other reviews of this product I noted a 'bump' issue similar to the one to this case. I suspect that quality control for this product may be lacking and I just hope that doesn't affect the durability as well as the aesthetics of the item.\n\nNOTE: Photo is of the top of the case with the 'bump' visible."

They do nothing for the neck of your guitar because they seal the moist sponge on the inside of your guitar body. It is worth your while to check out a type that does not seal the sound hole, held between a couple of the strings, etc. Some have said that, because they seal the soundhole, these are better suited for a guitar you keep out of its case, but again, if your air is dry enough to need one (40 to 50% Relative Humidity is the recommended range for acoustic guitars), then your neck will still get no benefit. NOTE on the harder plastic ring that some complain about - you NEED that to be resting on the TOP of the guitar around the soundhole - it separates the softer flexible plastic from your guitar's finish - to prevent damage to your finish."

I ordered a set of Original Vintage Telecaster pickups and when I metered them the neck pickup, which should be 7.7K ohms, it was 7.2K, and the bridge that should have been 7.2K ohms was 7.5K ohms. The exact opposite of what they they should be. The result is a lopsided set that works the opposite of what Fender sound engineers wanted. I put them in a Mexican Telecaster, and while they didn't sound bad, I am sure if they were wound the way they should have been, they would sound much better and work better together as a calibrated set. Fender can tell you it is normal to have pickups slightly different depending on who is winding them. A little different I can accept, not lopsided. Hey, guys ever hear of a rotation counter? And if they are off then match them so they still work together as a set. Put the weaker pickups together and the stronger pickups together. No, this is stupid idea. They would have to pay some poor guy in Mexico a few extra bucks to do this, the accountants would never go for it. The pickups are not bad sounding despite this, but I would buy Duncans until Fender can get its act together. But if you are considering GFS pickups and haven't read my other review, stay clear of them and get the Fenders instead."

        "reviewText": "\"These are the best vintage straps you can buy for the price and they look cool. Fender also makes a better quality vintage strap with a leather backing instead of felt. After using both for years, I kind of lean towards these because they are not so bulky, and look a little more vintage authentic with the felt backing. I like the way the strap fits in the strap button better as well. They are also cheaper, which is a plus. I would use the thicker vintage straps if the guitar you are using is a particularly heavy one, say over eight pounds, as the shoulder pad will give you better support.\"\n\nThat was my old review. I have purchased, in the past, four of these straps and they were all fine. I just received a new one that has a made in China tag sewed onto the felt and it is garbage. I suggest if you get one of these Chinese made straps and it is made incorrectly, send it back. There is no reason to have to suffer such incompetence. I will include that your guitar will eventually fall off of one of these badly made Chinese straps. Use at your own risk. The holes at the top of the strap on the shoulder pad where the straps slide through are also cut wrong and too big. I would also like to ask the question of why these straps have become about three or four dollars more and they are being made in China. The only explanation I can come up with is greed. So not only are Americans losing their jobs, Americans who buy these badly made Chinese straps are also being charged more. Here is the letter I sent to the seller and also Fender:\n\n\"Why is everything made in China a disaster? I have purchased, thru Amazon, four of these straps and everyone has been fine. I believe they used to be made in either Canada or the USA [The leather was stamped Made in USA]. This is the first one where the \"made in\" tag is attached, which I would have to cut off because it is annoying. If you look at the picture on the Amazon website, you will see that the smaller strap has four adjustment holes. This one has one whole, so I cannot adjust the strap properly and the whole is right on the end so the strap doesn't go through the buckle properly. Further, the felt on one end feels like it has glue on it or something. Felt is supposed to be soft. This feels like it was sprayed with glue because the felt is hard and rough. Regardless of these issues, the strap button holes are way too small. They aren't even close to the proper size so that the strap ends flares way out, trying to hold on with the slit, and the strap is not secure. The strap button is being held onto with the slit of the leather. The strap will detach if the strap is left like this. I have included a picture showing you the ends of two of my straps to the right, and the ends of the new strap with the tag still attached on the left [I attached a photo showing both ends of two old straps and both ends of the new strap. The whole size is completely different. The whole size on the new Chinese strap is so ridiculously small that it shows the level of incompetence and horrible quality control on Fender's part.].\nIn order for me to correct these, I would have to go to my local shoe repair place, and the minimum cost of repair will be the cost of the strap. Why does everything made in China come complete with some problem or issue? It is extremely frustrating having to deal with this kind of incompetence for no reason. Even if they were made incorrectly, Fender has to be responsible for quality control. It doesn't take a genius to see the whole is the wrong size. I could see it the moment I pulled it out of the package. This is maddening. Mistakes are made, people are human. I can accept that. But this is flagrant. There is no excuse on Fenders part and this can't be the first time this issue has come to your attention, which is perhaps why you don't have anymore of these. It is a waste of my time to have to take pictures and type emails and all the rest for an eleven dollar strap. How do you want me to proceed?\""

If you get one and it isn't right, send it back. Fender aftermarket products stink, in general. Fender QC has really gone down the tubes with its aftermarket parts."

When locked it's not too bad - but \"unlocking\" is pretty problematic.  Since the plastic pieces just push on, the typically simply slide on when you are attempting to remove the \"band\" - only they are not supposed to and the plastic piece falls out of the band and rolls around on the flood.\n\nIf you try what I did and use your thumb on the center of the plastic piece to stabilize it while removing the band the top of the plastic piece will fall off after a few times rendering the locking mechanism useless."

The tubes definitely can add some overdrive...Im just not sure if its the best sounding.  A good tube amp should give you this already, at least for guitar.  It seems Bass players are higher raters of this pedal than guitarists.  It is a bit tricky to find the best sound as there are so many variables.  It does seem to add some warmth to my hybrid amp (tube pre, trans. power).  It has not driven my MXR Super Comp out of my chain though, and is not the miraculous tone maker that some seem to describe...almost like its alchemy!  Seems reviews are over the top bad or good as they are written after first impression.  This pedal does little to affect your sound...which can be a good thing with compression.  I would like to try the Carl Martin I have heard so much about.  Seems the Keeley is rated high for the squash of Nashville.\n  I bought this b/c the price new was under $130. and I am still not sure I want to keep it.  Hopefully time , and experimentation will tell!  By the way I found it did not work well in the effects loop, though it seems few pedals do with my Tubeworks amp.

My main gripe is that the rubber piece where the cable meets the connector fell out of the connector with almost no pressure whatsoever applied to it. The purpose of this piece is to keep cable bending force from getting inside the connector and damaging the connections between the wires in the cable and the connector pins (usually solder connections). With the rubber piece not serving this purpose, the cable is likely to fail much sooner than it should. I tried to force the rubber piece into the connector but was unable to. Maybe if I disassemble the connector... but hey, I shouldn't have to do that. Maybe this cable is OK for a studio where it is installed and never moved, but I would never take it out on a gig."

This is a strong capo but there is NO cushioning for the palm and fingers so imagine pushing against a hard spring through plastic/metal material without any soft support for your hand. Not recommended! I was hoping it to be easier to put on as it is my left hand and it is so hard!!! I also use it on an acoustic which has a slightly thicker neck than an electric and it is impossible for me to unclamp and remove it with my left hand without it catching some string! I have been a musician for many years and have another capo but I wanted to try a new one in hopes of it being easily movable. This is not! I have to use my right hand to unclamp for a come off.

So much so that I checked with my guitar teacher who said he was not surprised. The quality appears good.

The cable is very generous and can always get power to my rig from anywhere in the clubs that I play. Even if they only have one outlet on stage and the guitar player needs it for all his pedals. I haven't had a chance to test how it handles power problems but so far I haven't had any issues to speak of. (Correction, see Update)\n\nIt is SOLID. Well worth the money. This is a no brainer.

        "reviewText": "According to my order history, I bought this this kit towards the end of 2012 as a Black Friday Week Lightning Deal. I'm writing this nearly four years later.\n\nAs with any stringed instrument, the strings really needed to stretch out before they would stay in tune. So, for the first several days, it was play a few minutes, tune, play a few minutes, tune. Then it was tuning daily. After a few weeks of this, the uke held a tune great. A tuner is not included in the package, which is the bulk of the minus star because a real beginner wouldn't have a way to tune the thing. (You need either a tuner or a reference note, say, on a piano or keyboard.) You can download a decent tuner app, though, for a buck or so. Do it, because you're going to need it a lot for the first couple of weeks.\n\nThe \"Firebrand\" ukulele is a laminated instrument of unknown wood. It's kind of dead-sounding. But then, soprano ukes generally sound a bit flattish to me - it's part of their distinctive character. The finish, while smooth, is spotty, and the decal around the sound hole has bubbles. But the fretboard is just barely adequately finished, with frets that are nicely flush with the edge of the neck so the feel is smooth - and has stayed smooth despite temperature changes. The beveled fret edges are filed, but not especially polished; even so, there's nothing to snag or catch. Fret dots are inset (one quite deeply) into the fingerboard and also painted on the upper edge of the neck, a nice touch. The action on mine is okay, at least down near the headstock where the starter chords live. The tuners are a triumph of cost-engineering: stamped metal with solid gears, so they're a definite step up from simple peg tuners. They make fine adjustments quite smoothly, and hold well over time. The bridge is slotted, so when you re-string you don't have to mess with that weird knot, just knot the end.\n\nI visited a specialty ukulele shop yesterday thinking of upgrading, and played with budget beginner soprano ukes costing three times what I paid for this whole set, and to me they played about the same and most even sounded the same; a few were a bit louder. They were all, however, finished to a much higher standard. I left empty-handed, but will probably get a better uke sometime soon. They're fun!\n\nThe bag is lightly made, unpadded, and has a fixed-length strap for carrying. It offered no advantage over just grabbing the uke to carry it, while adding the considerable disadvantage of needing to unpack it to play. It promptly went into the giveaway pile.\n\nWe haven't watched the DVDs, because the book has been great. It starts with C7 and F, and then adds C and G7, then G and D7. So it's not the C Am F G combo very common on YouTube. The songs are American folk traditionals, so if you've been around a campfire where any singing was involved, you've probably heard them before. There are lots of good instructions available online, including videos, so, really, the book is just a kick-starter to get you going. It's a pretty good book, with a reference section at the back with more chord diagrams than you're likely to need.\n\nIn all, it's an acceptable inexpensive starter set, not worth the \"list price\" but an OK value at Amazon's discounted price and a bargain at the Gold Box/Lightning Deal price.\n\nUPDATE: I changed the strings to the Aquila Nylgut AQ-4 set. Yeah, they're $10 strings on a $15 instrument, but the improvement in sound is just huge. I also polished the frets and fingerboard with a \"magic eraser\"-like product (an ultra-fine abrasive), shined up the body, and filed down the plastic saddle (which simply pops out of the bridge) to lower the action. It plays and sounds much better now, although the intonation remains sharp on several notes if you go note-for-note up the frets.\n\nUPDATE #2: OK, after going through the book I binge-watched the DVD. It consists of two segments of about 33 minutes each, each segment subdivided into easy-to-locate chapters that follow the pages of the book. It's really very good! The \"instructor\" (and remember, I bought this four years ago so this may have changed) was musician Julia Jordan. Production values were good, and the multi-angle views of playing were helpful, as were all the play-along segments. Minor quibbles: Jordan played a larger ukulele than the one in the pack, so you can't hold it in the exact same way. And it seemed like the songs were keyed to a higher register than her natural speaking/singing voice (you can hear her singing her own songs on a special feature and she's very pleasant to listen to).\n\nUPDATE #3: I now own a couple better ukuleles, have been a member of a ukulele meetup, and play a little almost every day. I can tell the difference between any of my better ukes and this one by both feel and ear. Still, it's a totally useable instrument, and it got me started on an enjoyable little musical hobby. Just remember to download a tuner app and maybe a metronome app and you're good to go."

        "reviewText": "I've played bass and guitar for over 30 years now. I've owned some excellent instruments along the way. Recently, for the first time, I decided I wanted to get something along the lines of the short-scale Gibson basses used by '60s British musicians such as Jack Bruce of Cream and Glenn Cornick of Jethro Tull. Real vintage '60s Gibsons are rather thin on the ground and quite expensive when still in good working condition, so a modern reissue was clearly the way to go. A bit of research suggested that the best candidate would be the Epiphone Elite EB-3 produced in the early 2000s, but those are no longer being made and I wasn't able to find one.\n\nThis left me with two main choices: the Epiphone EB-0 or the Gibson SG Standard Bass. (Epiphone also makes an EB-3, but only in long scale.) I found both of these in a local music store and was able to try them out side by side. Given the huge price difference (you can buy five Epiphones for the price of one Gibson) and the fact that the Epiphone lacks a bridge pickup, I expected the choice to be obvious and immediate in the Gibson's favor. I was mightily surprised, however, at how well the inexpensive Epiphone held its own against the higher-end instrument. While the SG Standard Bass certainly can produce a brighter and more diverse range of tones due to its dual-pickup design, the Epiphone's tone is quite pleasant and a pretty good approximation of the heavy, warm roar characteristic of the classic '60s short-scale Gibson basses. (Listen to Jethro Tull's song \"Nothing Is Easy\" for the sound of a vintage Gibson EB-0, or Cream's \"White Room\" for the EB-3.) The feel and playability of both instruments are excellent; the differences are not all that significant, though some may prefer one or the other. The Gibson's fretboard is slightly wider, but I preferred the narrower Epiphone.\n\nIn the end, I could not consider the five times greater price of the Gibson to be a worthwhile investment, so I bought the Epiphone and have found it to be an excellent instrument. Its range of tones is narrow; if the classic '60s Gibson sound is what you're looking for, look no further, but otherwise you should look elsewhere."

Why am I so impatient?\nThese were unbelievable right out of the box, bring my Strat to life, giving it an unbelievable feel and sound.\nBut, with every positive, there's usually a negative....and wait for it.....wait for it...yup, there was.\nI changed pickguards only two weeks after installing this on my Strat and noticed all three smaller strings. G,B &E were all flat on the fret side.  They were already worn out.

I'm going to step up to the 250's, then the 150 if I have to.  I love the sound but don't want to change strings every week.\nTo make a long story short, I wouldn't buy these again unfortunately and the search goes on for the perfect set of strings."

As another reviewer pointed out, it is extremely difficult and frustrating to point microphones exactly where you want them to be because the mount has threaded instead of smooth holes.  So you cannot simply place the mike clip where you want it and then crank on the tightening knob, because the microphone studs are not threaded the full length of the shaft.  This can be worked around by using washers/spacers, but finding thin washers in this size is difficult.\n\nThe bigger problem is that the cast mount is attached to the brass stud (what your mike stand screws into) by nothing more than friction.  It is easily popped off, which can send your microphones hurtling to earth.  This is exacerbated by the pivot which, though it seems like a good feature to have, is actually a disaster waiting to happen because it cannot be sufficiently tightened and with a couple of reasonably heavy mikes, the thing wants to flop around.\n\nThis is probably the worst device of its type.  I strongly recommend buying a different product."

Let me tell you why.\n\nThe rubber insulation on the cable is fairly soft and supple, making them nice and easy to stow away in a loop. The metal casings on the plugs are decent and can be unscrewed to open them making them serviceable should one of the wires somehow become disconnected.  Though you will have to remove the heat-shrink tubing which extends about three inches out of the casings. (You can see the white sheathing in the amazon photos). The only thing I might recommend that needs improvement is dropping the blue thread-lock on the threads inside the plugs because they tend to come loose over time.

Some drawbacks are the relatively bulkyness of this unit as compared to others.\nThe sound quality is sufficiently clear when recording, but is not sensitive enough to satisfy the most demanding users such as musicians or professional reporters.  As the other reviewers have said, you need a relatively loud source as there is no sensitivity switch or zoom feature.  It does have the 90-120 degree switch, so you can toggle the range depending on what you are recording.\nThis microphone is very compatible with many different devices.  MD is the best though.\nHere's one MD player recorder that I know has the microphone jack and works great with this microphone:\n'Sony MZ-NF810CK Net MD MiniDisc Recorder with Car Kit'\nHowever, don't be fooled.  Not every MD player has the appropriate Mic Jack.  Double Check the technical documentation to make sure.  Units that definitely do not have it are:\n'Sony MZ-NE410 High Speed Net MD Walkman Recorder'\nNotice the deceptive \"Recorder\" moniker in the product name.  Don't be fooled!  Very few MD \"recorders\" actually record with a microphone!\nNot sure about these:\n'Sony MZ-NF610 High Speed Net MD Walkman Recorder'\n'Sony MZ-N510CK NetMD Walkman/Recorder with Car Kit'\n'Sony MZ-N505 Net MD Walkman Player/Recorder'\nDo your research before purchasing any MD player.

You have to LEARN how to play it. Go to YouTube for help.\nThis recorder sounds clear and loud. Hole spacing seems correct. The holes are easy to cover and there is a clear distinction between notes.\nThick plastic makes it feel durable, but it's very light weight which makes it easier to play faster (since you aren't using much hand strength and coordination to hold the instrument up).\nLike any instrument, it will require some practice to get the hang of it and get proficient, but this is pretty easy to play. Meaning, you can get a good, strong sound and play some simple songs on it right away. At the price offered at the time of this writing (approx. $9), it's worth buying 2 (so you can play along with someone else)"

You can only hear the difference of comb material inside your head as you play. It has NO effect on the sound leaving the instrument into the room. Your audience will never hear a wooden comb vs. a plastic comb. The idea that they can is pure mythology--period. So save your mouth some pain and fatigue and get a Special 20."

Unless you have an extra space to store a pad saver, a bell brush, and a neck saver don't bother getting them, otherwise they leave all that moisture you were supposed to take out of your horn and ruins your pads an encourages the growth of mold. Avoid these and get a simple silk swab with a weight attached to a string. It gets the moisture OUT."

Upon looking at it you will first notice there is no \"Distortion\" or \"Gain\" knob to actually control the amount of distortion this distortion pedal produces.  This means it makes one sound and you get a 3 band EQ and volume knob, that's it.  That alone should be a deal breaker for most.  Now I admit this lack of control and versatility could be redeemed through a fantastic tone, but you will find no such quality here.  Do not buy this pedal, spend a little bit more on a different pedal or purchase a different pedal second hand for about the same cost as this heap.

An absolutely outstanding way to treat customers I would only hope that some other companies start to treat people the same way.\n\nThe Kyser Capo itself is a great Capo with just one major flaw which depending on how you look at it can be a major flaw or a minor flaw. The problem is the adjustability of the tension. There are YouTube videos out there from Kyser themselves explaining how you can actually been this into adjustability that you can work with. The problem is it doesn't exactly work is easily as they say it does. They are absolutely wonderful to deal with and they actually replaced an older capo for me free of charge. They claim that the older materials were not conducive to flexibility so they took it upon themselves to offer me a newer model. I appreciated that so much by that company that I ordered this one on Amazon just to show my support. Unfortunately it is still extremely difficult to pin this item to the desire tension that you needed for various guitar. Again I feel it is in either minor or major flaw depending on how many times you use it how many different guitars you use with it and so on. Myself, find this to be a minor flaw which is why I feel it gets an outstanding four star review. Of course with this one drawback it prevents me from giving it that final V Star which I allocate for absolutely perfect products that work flawlessly for me.\n\nKyser is an absolutely wonderful company to work with and they were very accommodating and I appreciate that and I will continue to support them and use their Capo happily, butt I just feel that it comes ever so sure of that 5-star because of that one option.\n\nNow as far as the rest of the Capo goes it is of course very easy to take on and off, attached to the end of the headstock if you wish, to get enough tension on just about any acoustic 6 string guitar that you're using it on. I don't believe that weight is really that significant for CatOS in this day in age, but to be thorough it is obviously a very light unobtrusive object to keep on the neck. It doesn't make the neck heavier and does not seem to alter the way the guitar feels feels in any way shape or form. It opens and closes snugly but you should be able to get used to that rather quickly. It is made like a truck so I don't believe you will have any problems in a year or 30 years. And I believe that the parts are replaceable where there is were possible. As stated before because of the great white shark like tension on this item you will not have a problem with string buzzing because of lack of tension."

Pressing upward releases the tension and you simply squeeze the capo over the desired fret until there is no longer buzzing and you haven't gone sharp. All well and good in theory. This is the 2 unit and the last I'm afraid.\n\n  Problem A - the lever for the thumb doesn't release as smoothly as you need it to causing a fumbling with the capo as you are trying to release  and pull it off. It's extremely poor when your are stretching to place in on the end of the headstock. You will drop it occasionally.\n\n  Problem B - Especially the second one I purchased had a problem of sticking or being sticky while opening. Jerky almost. In fact, the second one stopped opening. It just closed more and more and then stuck in the closed position. I literally received the package from Amazon, tried it once, took it off 20 seconds later and it never opened again. Placed my return within 10 minutes of UPS leaving.\n\nFinal thoughts - In theory it's great. Just being able to place your desired pressure on the capo without a level and spring or tension bolt, is great...unfortunately these guys just haven't gotten the mechanics down on making this gig worthy. It's slim and light design makes it really desirable and I've desperately wanted this to work, but I'm afraid I can't trust it. Very disappointed."

The only thing you need to do is ensure you've got them engaged properly at the time you attach your strap onto your guitar i.e. just make sure you established a solid connection then go ahead and gig your rear-end off without worry.\n\nThe design encorporates bearings that allow the strap to freely move around/rotate on the post, which is exactly what you want.  The schaller ones (see below) have a major flaw in them from my family's experience.  We will never run anything other than this design going forward.\n\nWhat doesn't work with the Schaller Design:\n\nOur family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist have been using Shaller-style locks for a while now.  Every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body. I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass...not good. My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend. The problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself.  We've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.\n\nWe tried to make the Shallers work but just could not.  Maybe we're all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us."

For some reason, somebody between Vater and the UPS person who received the shipment (I'm looking at you, AMAZON) decided to un-pair the sticks from their Vater sleeves, then repackage them in a long, plastic sleeve with the Vater sleeve folded up next to the sticks in the baggie. I could tell when I opened the box that it wasn't going to be right, and as soon as I held them in my hands, I knew they were different weights. Visual inspection showed one stick obviously longer than the other, and if you look at the photo of the butt-end of the sticks along the ruler, you can see that the cuts are at different points of the curvature. There was a difference of 6 grams between the sticks. I've uploaded photos of the initial shipment.\n\nIn all fairness, this is the first time I've ever had this problem ordering sticks through Amazon. I've got 7 other pairs that were just fine before this - two of which were Vater sticks (Power 5B Sugar Maple Wood & Xtreme Design XD-5B Wood).\n\nAs far as Vater sticks when they aren't tampered with from the factory - great products. I've got the Power 5B Sugar Maple Wood Tip sticks already, and the size is great, I just need something a little sturdier when I'm on an acoustic set. These would have been perfect had they been a properly matched set.\n\nI'm giving this product one star based on a hair-brained decision to un-pair and repackage the sticks somewhere along Amazon's distribution line."

Both -20 decibel attenuation switches are absolutely in the off position.\n\nThe volume level is lowered by a lot with this thing. Too much, in my opinion.\n\nIf I go straight into my powered speaker from the music source without this box connected, the sound level is much louder.\n\nYes, I detect less noise, if you will, when the box is utilized...but perhaps that is just because the box naturally drops the volume level as the signal is passing through it.\n\nAnd again, the two attenuation switches are off. This box has the capability to attenuate the signal either -20 or -40 decibels by either pressing in one or two of the attenuation switches.\n\nI doubt the box is defective. I think it was just designed to lower the decibel level automatically by default. Now, I guess if you have a powered speaker with enough headroom to make up for the volume drop, and if you do not mind running your speaker's volume knob much higher than normal, this natural volume drop via the box might not be an issue for you.\n\nFor example: Without the box I get great loudness from my powered speaker with its volume knob at its eleven o'clock position. With the box connected I have to turn the speaker's volume dial closer to the 3 o'clock position to get the same volume level. (Its maximum position is 5 o'clock, just for reference). This is way-too-big of a decrease of the sound level with this box connected.\n\nI also find the clarity of the sound a bit muddied when going through this box. And it is to a point where as a DJ this would be unacceptable...and that means I cannot use this box.\n\nThe only positive thing I found with the box is that it did successfully eliminate the ground hum when I tested that feature specifically."

The grounding issue renders them useless without some kind of wire harness to ground them to your body, which I have done, and it works, but is a pain in the rear. Do you want to tie and untie a wire from your wrist every time you put the bass down? I don't. The older coating from 10 years back or so did not have this issue. And even when plugged into my high end gear, I'll still get an electric pop or 2 if I don't run a wire ground, rendering tracks I record useless, I prefer to play tracks all the way thru with no punch ins. Beyond that, the tone and feel just isn't the same as the old coated strings. Frankly, these suck for passive basses that require a body contact ground. 2 stars for staying in tune like DR's always do for me, but I'm going back to low riders. Might try nickel low riders for kicks.\n\nOriginal review: Hmm. I am a big fan of DR strings but I'm not digging these so far. I used to use the peacock blue coated strings many years ago, I really liked them, the coating seemed smoother and more comfortable on fretting fingers, and I don't recall the \"non grounding\" issue with those older strings. This coating does prevent your fingers from fully grounding the bass (the hum does get cut a little, not all the way), which is an issue on the cheaper practice amps I have around the house and studio. I haven't used it for recording yet but through my DAW interface I don't notice much hum. If I had tape wound strings that have the same issue, we will see how that works out.\nI believe the older coated strings were also based on low riders, where as these are based on highbeams. Maybe I just like the feel of low riders better. Anyway, I'm surprised at how rough they feel on the fretting hand even with the coating. Not a big deal, but surprising. The sound is still bright and new after a couple weeks, so that's nice, the coating does seem to keep the strings sounding fresh longer, although I do like a more broken-in sound overall. I don't play a ton of bass so I assume if I played it more they would break-in, and as any experienced recorder knows, it's easy to dial out brightness, but it's tough to add it back in if you want to it, so this isn't really a big problem.\nThe jury still out for me, at this point I'm lukewarm, if I change either way I will update my review."

I am planning to use the lapel mic system with the Zoom H1 when I give talks that I want to record my voice in a consistent manner rather than having the zoom H1 mic recording from table top. So, I will put the Zoom H1 in my pocket and use the lapel mic. The sound on the ECMCS3 seems really superb to me, and the sound level is so much lower on the 10 that I think it's inadequate.

        "reviewText": "The short version of this review: If you're a beginner I would not recommend this product. If you're an intermediate player approach with caution. If you're looking for a solid tool for home recording consider buying a nicer virtual instrument plug-in for your DAW or perhaps even a real Pocket POD before this thing. I am very disappointed in this product considering the other options.\n\nGuitarPort is marketed as being both a educational tool as well as professional recording tool, I will review both aspects separately. To use GuitarPort as an educational tool requires a monthly subscription fee to GuitarPort OnLine. The monthly fee is less than ten dollars and for that you get a fixed library of professionally recorded hit tracks from the 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's, etc... For a given track you can download: without bass, without guitar or full mix. You can also download the guitar tab and tone settings. The tone settings will load the appropriate amp model, effects and then set up the amp and effects. You can hit the play and stop buttons and the tab will display on the screen. Sounds great right? Well, it is to a point.... The nice thing here is that you are downloading official tone settings and official tabs licensed by the publisher. The bad thing is that the tab playback software is pretty bad. It's just displaying a PDF on screen and scrolling as the track plays. If you've ever used a program like GuitarPro you will be very very disappointed in the TAB playback. Also the number of songs available is a problem. They aren't really updating their catalog. Lessons are OK at best (if the TAB playback where more like GuitarPro for features then the lessons would be much better, but it isn't). You might as well walk into a local music store and buy a book on playing, the lesson selections here (while some are very good) are not organized in a coherent way for a beginner. The product assumes the player knows what an effect box is, what the various settings on an amp does, etc... in short, it's not a beginners tool. Overall I would give this a grade C- as a learning tool. It has potential for intermediate players, but that's about it. There is another big problem with Guitar Port as an educational tool: NO BASS TABS are available through guitar port on-line and if you want the bass amp models and effects you will have to buy them on-line as an software upgrade for about fifty dollars! As a tool for bass guitarist, GuitarPort is useless.\n\nRegarding using GuitarPort for professional recording tool: When it comes to using software to simulate amps, rhythms, etc.. there are a few industry standards that make these sort of products compatible with a wide variety of DAW (digital audio workstation) recording software such as ProTools, Cakewalk, Ableton Live, etc..  the most popular standard is called VST. Line6 recently added GearBox VST as part of GuitarPort software package, so if you're looking to add Line6 POD quality models and effects for direct guitar studio recording, this is an inexpensive solution and really the only area in which Guitar Port shines (p.s. I still perfer the tone quality and features of Amplitube 2 for this sort of thing)\n\nOverall the GuitarPort a bit of a novelty product, it's not the amp models or effects are bad, it's just for about fifty dollars more you can pick up a PocketPOD and have all these great tones in a little battery powered, hand held device. You even hook the PocketPOD up to a PC using a USB cable and download the free software from Line6 to do almost everything you can with GuitarPort. I see a lot of positive reviews for this thing, so it seems it has made many people happy, but your money can be spent better elsewhere and if you are a beginner stay far away!\n\nOnly two stars for lack of coherence for the education/training this thing provides. GuitarPort on-line offers too little for what you get and absolutely zero bass guitar material in terms of tabs and lessons. Bass amp models (and a good number of PODxt models) require add on purchase here. You could easily spend $150 on add-ons before making the GuitarPort a viable studio VST instrument. Overall a decent product ideally that has been very very poorly executed."

        "reviewText": "Some history on this device: The Alesis SR-16 has been in production since 1991 and has gone through only slight revisions to the hardware since its original release. The 16-bit drum samples are still the same today as they were on this unit over 15 years ago. It is regarded as a break-through piece of studio gear and regarded by many studio engineers as the first rhythm machine capable of producing a convincing enough drum track capable of replacing a real drummer in studio recordings for rock applications. (Prior to the SR-16, rhythm machines were commonly used in pop music in the 80's, but it was always clear to trained ears that a rhythm machine was used, the SR-16 successfully blurred the line and made it possible to use rhythm machines in genres that generally frowned upon electronic drums such as: rock, country and blues) You'll hear the SR-16 on many professional tracks by top name recording artist from the early to mid-90's.\n\nToday the SR-16 can still be found in many professional and home recording studios. With the emergence of Pro Tools and other PC based Digital Audio Workstations, stand alone rhythm machines have become much less popular today in pro recording, but they are still very popular in home studios and for performing solo musicians around the world.\n\nComparing the SR-16 to newer products: Rhythm machines produced by Roland/BOSS, Yamaha and ZOOM are the SR-16's primary competition, with Roland and Alesis often cited as leaders and innovators in pro electronic percussion (these companies also produce the best quality electronic kits and the same samples are used in their rhythm machine products). Some of the features common to newer rhythm machines not found on the SR-16 include: 24-bit samples, more memory, bass guitar sequencer ability to store MIDI files on device.\n\nEase of use: Aside from its convincing sound quality, perhaps the reason the SR-16 has remained in production and a favorite among musicians is its ease of use. The SR-16 was designed with the non-drummer solo musician in mind and is considered one of the easiest rhythm machines to program. It's interface has been copied (but many would say not trumped) by BOSS, Yamaha and others. The manual, while poorly edited does more than any other rhythm machine owners guide to cater to solo musician who doesn't understand the first thing about sequencing drum tracks and it's A,FillA,B,FillB pattern foot switch configuration makes it easier to improvise with... In short, you don't get much customization with the SR-16, but what you do get feature was is going to be the most popular setup which makes the device much more approachable than many modern rhythm machines and sequencer options. Has a full MIDI in/out through implementation so the SR-16 can be patched in and controlled from DAW's (Pro Tools, Cubase, Live, etc...)\n\nComparing generations: If you're buying previously owned model be aware that some features have changed over the years. First generation SR-16 models (1991-circa 2001) had about 1/2 of the user memory than that of the current production SR-16. Also, the first generation units did not have a headphone jack. In the early 2000's Alesis updated all the preset patterns creating a market for \"vintage\" SR-16 machines. Also, over the years the price has dropped significantly. The SR-16 was originally marketed as a high-end studio product with a price tag around $400. While the quality of the unit has only improved, the price has dropped as computer parts have become less expensive (also newer units are mass produced in Asia)."

In other words it doesn't work well around corners, or even with other people standing between you and your subject.\n\n2. It does not function well at all in a busy convention center atmosphere. I just returned from a convention in Orlando where there were as many as fifty other wireless systems being used, and the Pro 88W system was almost completely useless. I had to resort to running a 12' cable to my spokemodel's microphone. Having more than just two channels may have helped this situation.\n\nCertainly the Pro 88 is a good value. It's constructed very well. I'm happy that it uses 3.5mm connections, (the same as my Canon DSLR) and requires a 9 volt battery, which are my favorite power source. However in my case I am going to have to upgrade to a more expensive UHF system.\n\nSincerely -\n\nRobert Marcos"

Unfortunately, they used an inferior grade of wood and the tips began to chip after only a few plays. Regarding the comments about the rubber creating blisters, that is only a problem if you grip these very tightly.  Back off a little and let them float and they just hang in perfectly. They also have a problem with the painted tips leaving marks all over your heads and cymbals.  They became completely unusable due to the broken tips.  They should leave the tips unpainted with a neutral treatment and use a different wood.  I would be happy to try an improved model maybe with nylon tips?"

I go from standard sometimes all the way down to B..As I was dropping the string, it just broke off. i've used nothing but Ernie Ball slinky's since I first began playing guitar and those are the strings that i've pretty much stuck to. They have never broken this quickly ever.\n\nI don't know if it's the quality of the d'addario's or my guitar has some bridge issues.. But I have never had strings break off on me so easily...Since Amazon is only offering Slinky's as add on items I went with these even though I had never used a set ....Maybe I was wrong to try a different brand I had never used..\n\nUPDATE: I was contacted by the company and they were able to solve my issue. I think I may have gotten some old sets,i'm not quite sure,but the year on the box was 2007,i'm not sure if that was the year the strings were made or just a random date on the box. But the company helped out and everything is good now :)"

        "reviewText": "----------Hohner Marine Band 1896 Classic:\n-(***__) Overall: The longtime favorite of many players, undisputed best for decades and, in my opinion, still a fantastic wood-comb harmonica at the mid-price range. Many pros still use it, though often custom versions (which any of us can easily buy, at a cost). The Marine Band has an amazing sound, but the reason I did not rate it higher is there are other harmonicas I prefer in terms of comfort and playability (full comparison and ranking below). My favorite wood-comb harmonica is the Marine Band Crossover, which is simply an upgraded version of the Marine Band 1896 classic. If you are a beginner I strongly recommend the Hohner Special 20 (plastic comb) for its ease of play. If you are willing to spend more I recommend the Suzuki Promaster (metal comb), which is my favorite off-the-shelf harmonica.\n-(*****) Sound: Excellent. This harmonica feels warm and deep. It is as good as my favorite: the Marine Band Crossover. However variations in sound quality between harmonicas are slight and likely to be lost on an audience. I'd much rather focus on getting a comfortable harmonica.\n-(**___) Comfort: Wood-comb harmonicas just never seem to be as comfortable as plastic-comb ones. The Marine Band is not the worst I have experienced, but the coverplates do stick out over the wood comb slightly. This means the lips press and slide against two sharp pieces of metal, which is uncomfortable. The Special 20 (plastic comb) and Suzuki Promaster (metal comb) are significantly more comfortable.\n-(***__) Playability: The protruding coverplates make it harder to get a tight seal and are an issue. I didn't have excessive gapping issues with any individual reeds or any being excessively out of tune. I didn't have issues with reeds getting \"stuck\", which is unusual at this price range.\n-(**___) Durability: Durability is the weakness of Hohner overall. With wood-combs you add the additional issue that the comb can/will warp over time.\n-(**___ Aesthetics): Very standard classic look, but the yellow coating on the wood is unattractive. I give it two stars instead of three because I much prefer the natural look of the Marine Band Crossover's wood comb. The carrying case is hard plastic and will break eventually, not as nice as the crossover's zippable pouch.\n\n-----------Qualitative Comparison with other mid-price Harmonicas (lowest to highest score)\n---(**___) Hohner Blues Harp: This is the harmonica I own that I don't enjoy playing. The redeeming quality is the Blues Harp sounds very good, enough to compete with any harmonica in its price range. However the metal covers protrude and are sharp on the lips, making it simply too uncomfortable to be any good. The Marine Band is more comfortable (covers protrude less).\n---(**___) Hohner Big River: Nothing memorable. It's perfectly fine but there's no reason to buy it over the Special 20(the $ savings is minimal). Unlike the Special 20 it has a wood comb, but if you want a wood comb buy a Marine Band.\n---(***__) Seydel 1847 Silver (plastic comb) and Noble (metal comb): Seydel 1847 and its distinctive steel reeds is the company's flagship and a harmonica I find very polarizing. positive is that the coverplates form an uniquely thin opening for the mouth which makes it extremely easy to play. The downside is my Seydel 1847's are my only harmonicas that sound undeniably unpleasant. Both harmonicas have a distinctly metallic tinny sound, which is probably due to the steel reeds, and explains why steel is not a common choice for reed material. Comfortable harmonica with tinny sound; overall not recommended.\n---(****_) Suzuki Pureharp: Having both coverplates and the comb made out of rosewood makes the Pureharp perhaps the most attractive harmonica available and theone with the warmest and most enjoyable sound. It is surprisingly easy to play, though the wood coverplates slide less smoothly and require more saliva. Not recommended for a fast song. Too unique to be a first harmonica, it is great for a player looking to expand their collection with a harmonica that has a great warm tone.\n---(****_) Lee Oskar Major Diatonic: Excellent harmonica, extremely comfortable, great sound. It is extremely similar to the Special 20. It has a good reputation for durability, and my experience is that it outlasts the Special 20. One downside is the plastic case can break within a month from normal daily opening/closing. Ultimately I prefer the Special 20: The Lee Oskar feels slightly thicker on the lips because of the way the coverplates are rounded, which I don't like\n---(****_) Suzuki Firebreath: Excellent harmonica but poor value for the high price tag. In true Suzuki style, this black beauty and its rosewood comb look stunning. The sound is awesome and distinct: it is very soothing and my absolute favorite for slower melodies. The Firebreath is comfortable for a wood-comb harmonica; no sharp angles. The drawback is I find it difficult to get a tight seal on this harmonica and therefore can't comfortably play blues or other fast music. This is my favorite high-quality harmonica for slow songs, but I do not find it versatile and would not recommend it as a first/main harmonica or as a blues harmonica.\n---(*****) Hohner Marine Band Crossover: My favorite wood-comb harmonica. This is an upgraded version of the Marine Band 1896 Classic. The nails that hold shut the 1896 have been replaced with screws that permit cleaning and replacing the reeds, the comb's yellow finish has been replaced with a smooth clear finish which keeps the natural color of the wood and looks much better. It comes with a great zippable case, which is the best of any harmonica. The Crossover maintains the great tone of a Marine Band, producing a great wood comb harmonica.\n--(*****) Hohner Special 20: My favorite Plastic Comb Harmonica, and outstanding in terms of comfort and ease of play. The plastic comb protrudes, making it extremely comfortable and smooth to use. The sound is great. Durability is terrible. The case is more durable than the Lee Oskar one but not as nice as the (excellent) pouch that comes with the Marine Band Crossover.\n---(*****) Suzuki Promaster Valved: This metal-comb harmonica is my favorite off-the-shelf harmonica. It hits all the marks with a great sound and a particularly outstanding playability. The surface is smooth and comfortable on the lips and allows for a tight seal and easy playability. The harmonica is shiny and sleek looking, and comes with a good quality plastic case with rounded corners that make it comfortable in the pockets. If I could only own one off-the-shelf harmonica I would own this one.\n\n---------- Custom Harmonica:\n--(*****) Antony Dannecker Optimus: Simply the best harmonica I have played, but comes at a price. Antony is great and very available if you want to discuss any particular tweaks to your custom harmonica. This very heavy harmonica is objectively the easiest to play out of the many I own. I literally stopped to smile the first time I tried it. We can debate forever if it's actually worth the high price, maybe it isn't. What's certain is that a great harmonica is not enough to make you a great player but also that off-the-shelf quality can't compete with the Optimus.\n\n----------Note on the 2-draw:\n1-2-star reviews often complain their 2-draw was broken from day one. The 2-draw most likely is not broken, it is simply a very difficult note for beginners to play.\n\n----------Note on which key to buy first:\n--Start with a key of C.\nThis is the accepted standard since most beginner songs and lessons will all be in C. One harmonica is fine as a beginner.\n--Then: A, D, G\nA is common in blues and country. D is also common. G is often used when playing along with guitar.\n--Then Bb, F, E,... here is gets more debatable\n\n---------- If any edit would improve the review quality/thoroughness/clarity write me a comment."

This was my fault for overlooking this in the product description. The reason for the low review is ... I bought 2 of these and seen that they do not heat evenly from unit to unit. Thermal protection does not allow them to operate until cooled down, thus I was not able to have fog on demand when desired. I will figure out a way around this but I just expected a more uniform product from Chauvet."

After doing tons of research and talking to two friends that are in the recording industry I decided to go with an XLR mic and this one because of reviews and recommendations.\n\nAfter ordering and getting the Mic I was unable to get it to work using an M-Audio audio interface which I assumed was probably a driver or firmware issue. After spending a week updating/downgrading drivers and motherboard firmware on my Windows 7 64bit computer and also testing on my wife's Windows 10 laptop I ended up ordering a phantom power supply and buying another audio interface from a local brick and mortar store. This still did not get the mic working. I spoke with an Audio professional and he walked me through a few hours of trouble shooting and again still was not able to get it working.\n\nSo after spending almost 300$ on top of the 100$ microphone I ended up RMAing it back as well as the other equipment I bought and went with a Samson C03U which worked immediately out of the box and cost me 90$ without any extra equipment. I'm sure it was probably just a fluke but it left such a sour taste in my mouth I didn't want another one."

Not to mention, it's probably also one of the most modded pieces out there. Any number of mods can be found online to change the sound. They're usually on the side of improving the stock tone, which I'm happy with.\n\nI've always liked the parametric EQ on this pedal. The variable midrange allows me to get Marshall or Mesa flavors. For most metal/hard rock music, the gain range is enough for me. If I need yet more gain, I punch it up with an overdrive, or a compressor pedal for a cleaner boost. Even without a boost, I can use it for death metal. I think if you play the tighter, more technical styles, it's better not to have too much gain anyhow."

There is ONE thing I don't like it about it. If you have a Les-Paul style guitar, one of the arms that cradle the guitar on the bottom is EXACTLY where the cable jack is located. So you either have to lean your guitar one way or the other if you put it on the stand while plugged in, which is pretty frequently for me. Kind of annoying!"

The Carvin strings (made by La Bella) that came on the Bass were good, but I wanted to try a few others out. I do like Ernie Ball Super Slinky Guitar Strings so I tried this set of Bass strings.\n\nThey seem to be okay, not any better than the Carvin strings I had on the Bass. I just bought some D'Addario EXL 170 strings which I haven't tried yet. I have used Dunlop Steel-Nickel's on another Bass I have and liked them. If I am not satisfied with the D'Addaio's, I'll probably try DR Marcus Miller's."

On my hollow body Taylor T5, this may not be a big deal, but on a heavy guitar like a Gibson Les Paul it can be a big deal.\n\nAlso, my strap ends had double leather so the locks did not fit out-of-the box.

Nevertheless, I can't recall ever having this much trouble with guitars tipping over.  Breathe on it, over it goes.  Look at it, guitar's in the floor.  A flatulent dog?  Guard your guitar!  The security strap keeps the neck from falling out of the cradle, so the guitar and stand kind of spill over as a unit.\n\nI'm going to try popping the rubber caps off the legs and pouring some BBs in there for added weight.  I think it's just a question that this stand is a few ounces too light.  It's probably made of steel tubing one gauge lighter or something.\n\nI'm on the fence between two stars and three, but the more I think about it, the more I regret the purchase, so I've decided to go with two stars."

I decided to roll the dice anyway, and I got a shiny metal tooth chipping machine for my trouble.\n\nThe whistle looks great, and it feels solid and well-made.  The issue, as described by several other reviewers, is the fit of the piston within its cylinder.  In the case of my whistle, it's quite stiff, and getting it to move requires considerable muscle input.  What happens when you have a hard metal object in your mouth, and you apply a heavy amount of elbow grease to attempt to send part of it moving toward your face?  If you're not careful, you'll chip your teeth!  Trying to slide it down tends to pull it from your mouth, so when you try to slide it back up, you have effectively backed up to give the whistle a good running start at kicking you in the teeth again.  This is not pleasant!\n\nI tried to get the action to loosen up by cycling it repeatedly across its full stroke, enduring many lewd comments from my family as I sat there on the couch moving my slide up and down repeatedly.  As I worked it, white grease started to work its way out the bottom, so the whistle definitely came lubricated from the factory.  I worked it until the metal started to get hot from the friction, and then I worked it longer. I added various brass instrument valve oils through the mouthpiece, as there is no way to remove the plug at the bottom without drilling out the places where it is peened into place.  In the end, I wound up with a foul-tasting, oily, hard metal tooth chipper that functions somewhat less poorly than before, but it is a long way from being even slightly usable.\n\nI gambled, I lost, and so it goes."

I mean, look at 12 fret its 10 millimeters.  I don't know much about classical but it is not what I would call great playability.  Of course, you can play on this guitar, I do.  But it's hard.  I suppose, one shouldn't expect much from $100 dollars instrument.  But I repeat, it's not great.  Now about bass strings.  They sound bassy, as I suppose, they must.  But the thing is their bassines overpower trebles. Trebles sound unproportionally weak. And yes, yes.  I did changed strings on a good ones (D-Adario normal tension something) upon getting this guitar from Amazon  I should say though that guitar starts to sound much better now than it was when I just got it.  But action on this instrument still kills my fingers.  I do finger pushups in order to develop muscle on my phalanges, in order, to play on this guitar somehow.  Of course, I could ask professional to fix bridge nut, but why would I do it for such cheap guitar.  My verdict-unless you want to develop your fingers, in order, to pull out nail with your bare hands, go for it.  I will send it back, and buy myself inexpensive Spanish brand."

I also didn't particularly care for the push button release, and getting the locking part on the end of my thick strap was a challenge; these have a C clamp, not a nut, so there's no allowance for differing thickness. I also felt safer with the Schallers, which hook onto the end of the guitar strap button and didn't depend on a spring loaded button to keep the parts together.  As I said, I had no real problems with them, so if they look like they'd work for you, great.  As with all replacement strap locks/buttons, you have to make sure the screws are secure in the button holes before you start jumping off of drum risers, dropped out of airplane, or what have you."

From the picture, I thought it would have a more \"lived in\" feel and look. As others have mentioned the holes in the ends are far too small to use with strap-locks so it's necessary to trim the leather away to make the hole larger if you're gonna  use strap-locks. Unfortunately for me, I made the holes larger before I realized that I could have just returned it to Amazon. So, I'll keep it as a back-up strap, but I don't like it much."

This wah pedal just doesn't cut it.  Maybe at one time, but not today, it hasn't been up to par in a LONG time.  As a young player I insisted on having a wah pedal.  My mom bought me this one.  I thought it was awesome until I learned better.  It took me about a week to learn how to turn it on and when I finally did I thought I broke it!\n\nThe eq on this pedal isn't good, there is no smooth transition from heel to toe.  There is a big drop in the freq. that kills the effect.  You have to pump your foot really fast to avoid having that drop.  You have to pretty much push it toe foward and then literally stomp on it to turn it on and then follow the same steps to turn it off.  Very inconvenient for someone who is trying to rapidly move between effects on a board.  I can't say its just a complete piece of junk, it does give you a wah effect, it is a classic pedal but THERE IS BETTER out now so why are we still stuck in the stone age with this thing?  I even had someone mod mine and while it gave it a little more headroom and fixed the dropping issue, I still had to slam on it to turn it on/off and it still sounded like a cheap wah.\n\nMy suggestion?  The Mark Tremonti wah is great!  Kicks this things end when it comes to range and simplicity to use!  It may cost more, but you will probably end up hating the crybaby and getting one anyway, so just go with the Tremonti Power Wah to begin with.  What I use for wah is the Digitech RP250 processor.  You may say that this is a cheap processor, and it is, but I've been using it for years and I haven't seen anyone that can tell the price of it based on the sound quality and thats what matters.  Why I suggest it for wah is you can control the sensitivity, how hard you have to press your toe down to turn it on (I have mine set fairly light) and you can totally shape your tone right there on the board very easily.  You even have presets (crybaby being one of them)  You can get an entire processor full of effects AND an awesome wah for a little bit more.\n\nIf you want a cheap child's gimic-type toy, this is for you.  Want to get serious about a wah?  Spit on every crybaby you see and go elsewhere."

I run a Randall G3 hybrid amp and it destroys any solid state I've used or heard.  For recording I use a Peavey 5150 and its so sweet.  Tubes are how guitar was meant to be heard.\n\nRecently I started playing with a band that required a dirty tone that I felt like could only be achieved through a pedal.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with using distortion pedals, I used the DOD death metal for years when I first started playing.  However, there is a downside.  Go cheap and you get a piece of crap that makes your rig sound like an old AM radio, if you want something that sounds pro quality your going to shell out at least $250.  Quality dist. pedals are not budget friendly.\n\nI chose the MT-2 because I know Boss makes a quality product and it was the pedal the other guitarist was using.  It gives a variety of sounds.  It can be set up for an overdriven light distortion sound or full blown high gain metal tones.  The controls make it very tweakable and I have gotten a load of very nice sounds out of it.  Read the included book, look up some MP3s over videos online and check out other guitarists' settings.  It will help you tame this pedal into what you want.  Perfect pedal for those not wanting to spend a whole lot.  There are also mods you can buy and install in the pedal or buy preinstalled from certain dealers that open it up to even more shaping and make it more useful.\n\nI've seen a lot of complaints about the pedal sounding like nothing but fuzz.  I must say learn how to shape sound, spend time dialing it in to your rig.  Within 10 minutes I was pleased with the MT-2.  I used it on my overdrive channel to push it harder and got a really thick, heavy distortion with a good response.\n\nI say the MT-2 is worth an investment if you're looking for a big distortion sound from a little pedal.  Surely something guitarists should consider adding to their board."

I did a guitar spin at a show and the guitar went flying.  The strap lock was still on the strap and locked into the holder.  The screw had ripped out of the horn of the guitar!  The screw tore through about a half inch of solid wood (and I epoxy all my screws in) before the strap lock broke.  Amazing.\n\nNice, tough hardware.  The only complaint I have is that you must use screws with small heads if you choose not to use the stock screws provided.  Easy to install, just unscrew your stock strap holder and screw in the lock holder.  Attach the lock to your strap and BAM quick release system.  Fast to take on and off of your guitar.\n\nI would suggest getting a tough, thick leather strap with a nice reinforced eye to install the quick release button in, cheap lightweight straps will eventually start to tear.  Also, the button can be a slight pain to get on certain straps.\n\nI have now switched over to DiMarzio clip lock straps instead of the leather straps with Dunlop locks for many reasons and I am very happy, but this product is GRADE A! I always felt 100% secure with these straplocks.  Our bass player uses some expensive (and heavy) Fender basses and he loves these strap locks."

I only have two complaints.\n\nThe first is that the side handles are not great once the weight of everything inside exceeds 50 pounds. They're only semi-circles and they really dig into your hands, even though I always carry this with someone else on the other side.\n\nThe second complaint is kind of a catch-22....I think there should be a model that does NOT feature the lock and key. It's a nice touch and idea, but in the case of this rack, when you're putting the covers on or off for transport, you have to tilt it away from you to get the bottom tabs of the covers in or out of their slots. Takes a little more time, effort, and care than you'd want\n\nIf you need the locking capability, this is a good idea. But keep that in mind if you're really going to load this--for me, this is loaded with around 60 pounds of equipment, and only about 15 of that is on one side, so one side is somewhat difficult to take the cover off.\n\nNo problems with dents or actually mounting the equipment, though--this is rock-solid overall.\n\nIf you aren't going to be loading this with lots of heavy equipment, I definitely recommend it. Otherwise? It's still a good rack, just consider the aforementioned flaws first."

Yes, I could have treated the unit better, but I'd bet that a lot of folks open it the way I did.\n\nIN ANY CASE, it no longer works now. There wasn't a moment when i felt like i broke it, i just tried to use it one day and it failed. The lock on the legs has failed and it will no longer do it's job to hold my guitar up. Therefore, I still will be buying a stand that can stand the test of time (and my ownership). I've owned some Hercules gear for a couple years now. It's more expensive for sure, but they're products haven't broke on me yet."

The only thing I like about these are that it has the cord coming from one side vice both.\n\nDurability: 1 out of 5.

Here are my thoughts on a number of Levy's straps.\n\nFirst off, I think it's worth it to spend some money on your guitar strap. If you want to feel spoiled when you put your guitar on, get a nice looking strap.\n\nAn important secondary benefit is the comfort. Even my heavy Epiphone Les Paul (almost 10 pounds) feels good with a nice, wide padded strap.\n\nLevy's straps are among the best on both accounts. I have four Levy's straps and feel I've had varying levels of success in getting what I wanted. Here's a little info on each of them.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Levy-s-Leathers-PM32-BLK-Garment-Leather-Strap-with-Foam-Pad-Black/dp/B0002D0CRG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Levy's Leathers PM32-BLK Garment Leather Strap with Foam Pad,Black</a>&nbsp;While this strap is comfortable, it is rather plain. It has an embossed Levy's logo on it. This was the least expensive strap that I bought, and it does the job, but is not so inspiring putting it on. In all honesty, I wish I would have spent a little more to get a nicer looking strap. Odds are that I will have this strap for decades and for another $5-$30 I could have gotten something really spectacular.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Levy-s-Leathers-MSS1-BLK-Veg-Tan-Leather-Guitar-Strap-Black/dp/B000XPSL8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Levy's Leathers MSS1-BLK Veg Tan Leather Guitar Strap,Black</a>&nbsp;This strap is similar to PM32 but has a brown logo on it. The logo adds a lot as it is front and center on the strap. This strap cost $10 more than PM32 and in my opinion is well worth the extra ten bucks. (But I regret not going two tone with this strap.)\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Levy-s-Leathers-MSS1-WAL-Veg-Tan-Leather-Guitar-Strap-Walnut/dp/B000XPUOVW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Levy's Leathers MSS1-WAL Veg Tan Leather Guitar Strap,Walnut</a>&nbsp;I bought this strap for my brown sunburst Telecaster and was really disappointed. Rather than being a brown, it is actually a burgundy. It did not go with the guitar at all. I was going to send it back, and then I realized it matched my Stratocaster with the tortoise pickguard. In fact, it matches it really well so I kept it and I'm extremely happy with it. The two tone, black and burgundy, strap really looks classy. I think the two tone is the way to go. However, in some cases you need to spend an extra $20-$30 for certain two tone colors. In my opinion it is worth it to spend the extra money. Leather guitar straps last for decades.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Levy-s-Soft-Suede-Guitar-Strap-Brown/dp/B0002GL4O8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Levy's Soft Suede Guitar Strap Brown</a>&nbsp;I bought this strap at my local music store. It was the nicest that they had and it was my first Levy's strap. It is also the least expensive of the bunch at under $40. And I consider one of the nicest straps that I own. The things that I like about it are that it is very soft and flexible. The leather straps are stiffer and not as supple. Another great thing about it is the brown suede with the black bead along the edge that gives it a two tone effect. I really like the look. That's why I put it on my most expensive guitar, even thought is was the least expensive strap. The only downside was that it left some suede particles on my shirt the first few times that I used it. However, that stopped after a few uses.\n\nAny of the last three straps listed above are a joy to own. But if you're looking for great value, great comfort, and a great look, I think the suede strap meets all three criteria. But don't be afraid to spend $80 on a nice two tone leather strap either. Chances are that you'll own it for decades."

The leather is so thick that I can't even get rubber washers over it to circumvent this issue.  It seems to fit slightly better over a different guitar because the buttons are longer... it still doesn't fit right, but I will be able to put rubber washers to prevent slipping.  I wouldn't dare use this strap on my super spendy Taylor.  It's too bad.  I really like the strap.... and I can still use it so it's not a total loss.  They just need to model their leather ends after the many other companies that have seemed to figure this out."

I actually use it with both an acoustic electric guitar to get a little distortion and the bass guitar for some grit. The 2 EQ pots on the front panel make it very versatile, enough to use with a cigar box guitar also.\n\nThe pedal can preserve bass signal and still be EQ'd for saturated distortion. The other reviews speak for this pedal both here and on other sites and one can see why it is so popular. I also other Boss Distortion pedals. Like most people, I own a DS-1 and an MD-2 which are both cheap and effective. I own a HM-2 Heavy Metal 2 which caters more to the traditional metal sound and I actually think this pedal is more versatile IMO with different guitars where you may not want a strictly metal tone.\n\nI also own an older 80's HM-2 Heavy Metal which will run circles around the metal zone for classic thrash and speed metal tones and almost any other heavy distortion pedal that I could never part with, overall i like this pedal, but it cannot top the older legendary Boss pedals."

Like I said I have borderline abused this unit as any working musician normally does with their gear and this thing is built like a little tank and has served me very very well, and I would definitely recommend this unit to anyone who needs a sustain pedal for any type of keyboard. This particular unit is actually pretty nifty and small compared to a lot of the other units on the market which are bulky and cumbersome and take up a lot of room when packing up especially when you have limited space in your flight case, but this guys fit right in with my keyboard flight case in my extra storage compartment"

BUT this last one had a SOOOO MUCH spring tension that my 11 year old couldn't even use it. The compression on the strings was so extreme that it made the guitar (every guitar) play sharp. It's fine for pkaying solo, but you can't use it for a key change on one instrument and play with another properly tuned instrument (which is kind of the point). I'm also concerned about what it would do to frets after prolonged use.

It is indeed possible I got recieved a bad copy, but I don't think so. I wanted to try one out before buying at a local music shop and they chuckled and said... no we don't carry them... I think I know why now.\n\nI wanted something I could travel and take on a plane with me while on business. After reading the reviews it seemed this might be exactly what I wanted. I was not worried about the sound quality. I simply wanted something that was playable and that I could use to practice a little on the road. Scales etc..\n\nThe product it isn't terribly built, and there is a general appearances that some thought went into the design of this, but quite frankly I found this thing completely unplayable. It has a truss rod adjustment so I was able to get the bow out of the neck (the truss rod was not adjusted at the factory), however the action was so high I couldn't actually play a chord past about the 3rd or 4th fret. Even trying open chords it was.. .cumbersome.. So the decision to return was easy.\n\nI suspect with some work I could file down the nut and bridge and to potentially get the action low enough to make this playable. However I decided to return this and not waste any more of my time.\n\nI have read glowing reviews and I can only conclude that they were planted by the manufacture or the folks who bought don't really play guitar. Again I don't care about the tone (a bit like a Ukulele which isn't very good) but that isn't my issue it is the playability, and from that perspective this is useless. Get some strings and a wash board, you will have more success.\n\nFor people who actually play guitar and need something playable, there are some other travel options out there (more expensive) such as short scale guitars (baby Taylor, Martin) and some fullscale oddball travel guitars. I guess I'll have to investigate those.."

The eq knobs are stacked the up eqs are higher freq while the lower half of the knobs are lower freq. You also have the usual gain and level knob.

I just couldn't bring myself to give them a 4/5 so I went with 3/5, here's why:\n\nI've used standard medium picks for over 20 years. Switching to these was not a problem at all. Sure, they are smaller but not small enough to cause me any problems. By far the biggest change was the \"pointy-ness\" of the picks. The distinct point on the pick drastically changes the sound of your playing, especially when playing chords. Everything is much more pronounced, which isn't necessarily a good thing in my opinion. It's especially bad when playing clean electric (picking notes or strumming).\n\nIf someone was to ask me if these are good picks, my answer would be \"it depends.\" It really does, in my opinion, it depends on what you're playing. From a rhythm standpoint, I don't like these at all - they take the warmth out of the chords because the point of the pick makes strummed chords sound too sterile to me. For lead work they are OK because you can really dig into each note and have it come through.\n\nCould I play faster with them? No. Could I pull off amazing licks that I couldn't do with my normal picks? No.\n\nI tried them, but didn't like them. Maybe if you typically play a TON of lead work, constantly, these would be the way to go. I don't, and they aren't for me. I'm glad I tried them, though, because I'll never wonder again if they were for me."

A copy of Alfred's Teach Yourself to Play Ukulele with a CD\n3. Extra strings\n4. A \"gig\" bag.\n\nThe uke is laminated wood and  mediocre. The strings are average in quality. The book is fine, though I prefer&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Play-Ukulele-Today/dp/0634078615/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Play Ukulele Today!</a>&nbsp;for the rank beginner (it teaches the notes on the strings) and if you are somewhat familiar, then I prefer&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Ukulele-for-Dummies/dp/047097799X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ukulele for Dummies</a>&nbsp;which has a lot on not only playing, but strumming, picking, styles and has a CD and many types of songs to learn.\n\nAs to the uke, believe it or not, a plastic-and-laminate&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Makala-Dolphin/dp/B0037CMDE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Makala Dolphin</a>&nbsp;though it looks like a toy, is an excellent instrument and when set up with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Aquila-Strings/dp/B003NJF1G8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Aquila Strings</a>&nbsp;sounds amazing. Many \"pro\" ukulele players and those who are advanced and own instruments that cost into the thousands, own a Dolphin and play it with pleasure. It comes in a myriad of colors, so if you are looking for something battle-solid, funky and kid-friendly, the Dolphin with Aquila strings has it all.\n\nIf you want to save money, this still is a good deal, but I suggest you change the strings to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Aquila-Strings/dp/B003NJF1G8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Aquila Strings</a>&nbsp;no matter what spare strings come with it. This is a soprano, by the way, so when buying strings, that's the size to look for. Aquilas are made of a nylon that makes a loud, rich sound and they are known for bringing out the sound of even poorer quality instruments. And you need a tuner--the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Snark-Tuner/dp/B003VWKPHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Snark Tuner</a>is not expensive and can be used on other types of instruments as well (guitar, etc.)\n\nThis was a good deal at under thirty simoleons, but if you are really serious to learn uke or want your kids to learn, the setup I mentioned may keep them interested longer. The quality of strings and the quality of a cheap uke can be optimized to the point where it's more than barely playable, and one mistake people make when taking up a musical instrument is to buy one that is so inexpensive, that it frustrates the learner. I have had this happen with the flute and the guitar. It really makes a difference what you learn on, and you have to balance the desire not to invest too much at first with the fact that too cheap a setup will just lead to failure.\n\nFor the record, I own a red Dolphin. I played uke as a kid and was able to pick up the instrument after 50 years of not playing, learn fingerstyle (picking) and enjoy playing it until I got a more serious instrument that indeed plays more sweetly. But I actually play the Dolphin quite a lot and enjoy its sound.\n\nThe setup I propose here will do you better as an adult, and will suit a child as well. You'll spend about twice as much but your chances for success are, in my opinion, a lot better. There are some excellent sites to visit to get free advice and to subscribe to video lessons (ukulele underground is my favorite.) Check out what I say and see if others don't agree with me. At the very least, if you opt for this package, get the better strings and the tuner. I guarantee you will be happier."

I wanted to see if the original screws held the button, and they are generally shorter than the ones required by this system. To my surprise, when I tried to extract the screw, its somewhat bigger head embedded itself into the button and could not get out easily. I eventually did without damage.\n\n2) As someone recommended, be sure that the provided screw fits easily into the guitar's original hole. If it doesn't, the screw's figure will be deformed, since it seems to be a fairly soft material. At the moment you feel any strong resistance, you better go back and carefully try to widen the hole. It wouldn't be a good thing if you are stuck with a strap button only halfway inserted, and with a busted screw that you will not be able to easily get out. Trust me, be patient with this, or else the screw will be gone."

It works great with my Telecaster!  But it makes me nervous with my '73 Gibson Les Paul. The Les Paul is so bottom-heavy that it's too easy to tip the stand and guitar forward, and the pendulum effect of the free-hanging guitar takes over and it all falls forward. (Don't try this at home unless you're standing right there in front ready to stop the pendulum!) In other words, the design of the stand allows the guitar to hang too close to vertical, and if the guitar is extra heavy, it can be tipped forward with a relatively light-to-moderate bump from behind. Front-to-back and side-to-side stability is very good even with the Les Paul and even with pretty solid bumps. I'm no engineer, but I would redesign this stand with four legs, adding a second leg in the back, and increasing the backward tilt of the stand."

It is quite uncommon for me, with the strings I normally buy, to have a brand new string snap.  I've been playing for a couple of decades now, and was even using a headstock tuner, so over tightening was not an issue. I continued stringing....only to have one of the B strings snap as well... long before it was close to a B.\nFortunately, I save my old strings aside -- just for this eventuality -- so I re-installed two of my old strings and was able to get playing.  (Note - the D'Addarios did not break!)\nThe Earthwoods sound alright once installed (remember, I have two D'Addarios on there) however I doubt I will bother with these again. I don't like mixing old and new strings, and don't feel a need to put up with brand new strings breaking.  I'll play it this way until I can get to the store for another set of D'Addarios."

It can produce decent analogue (MOSTLY analogue, see below) reverb, even enough for some surf sounds, but the short spring lengths restrict dwell time compared to Accutronics tanks.  I looked inside, and noted that the footswitch is not a typical design, but rather a momentary unit that latches some sort of circuitry.  Probably sturdy enough as switches go, but who knows?  I've had the unit for some months, but only have about 20 hours use on it.  The knobs all function, with \"Volume\" being a wet-dry blender. The DSR-1 is not true bypass, and must be powered to operate.  The 9-volt battery door is easily accessible and clips back in place firmly.  The DSR-1 takes a standard center-negative wall wart adapter, but the two I tried induced too much hum, so I run it with an old Boss RPW-7 multi-tap power supply which is quieter.  On battery power it is hum-free.  The large 6 1/2 x 9 1/4 metal case is heavy-duty, and the jacks are good quality, as is the on-off light.\n\nDanelectro apparently felt they had to 'thicken' the sound due to the short dwell, and added a bit of short-delay digital echo.  It's acceptable, but I would have preferred an internal off switch for it.\n\nIf you're doing a lot of surf music, this probably won't be 'wet' enough, but for short money (compared to an outboard tube reverb unit) it gets the analogue sound."

I had no problem attaching it to the neck of the guitar - the instructions were a little confusing at first, but once I played with it a bit,  I was able to figure it out.  I will say it is fun to be able to play chords at the start and helps familiarize the absolute beginner (me) with how the chords work.  I can't yet speak to how well the device helps you progress with learning the chords - it is a novel concept: you gradually remove the \"keys\" and finger the chords yourself, ultimately removing the device entirely once you've mastered the chords. I agree that it takes a bit of the frustration of learning, because you are playing chords right away, and I think that helps make learning fun.\nReally, my only complaint is that it's a bit expensive. The jury is still out as to whether it's worth the price or not."

In fact the telelock mechanism is a great innovation too . . .\n\nHere's the \"BUT\":\n\nI have to give them a poor rating on a few accounts.  First & foremost is that these stands rattle, and not softly.  I have 4 of them, and they all rattle.  The frequency range in which they rattle is roughly 69-98Hz.  The sound clearly comes from the telelock mechanism.  Since all 4 of the ones I have do this it can't be coincidence, but instead poor design.  One of my stands has lost its \"grip\" to keep the pole slipping downward while the telelock is on the raise setting as well, but that's just 1 out of 4 (you may be wondering why I have 4 - I work as a professional DJ, and it's important to always have backups.  Therefore you always buy more than what you need.)\n\nHere's the other huge problem with these stands - Ultimate Support's support.  Currently I have a very nice rep working on the case for me who seems to be a little more proactive.  However, I called Ultimate Support over a year ago about the issue with the vibration in these stands.  I even sent an audio file to them where they could place a speaker on a stand, play the audio, and hear it for themselves.  I've had to call way too many times to attempt to get this issue resolved.  This is seriously unprofessional to drop the ball this badly.  Not only that, but I have another Ultimate Support product that was faulty from the start - a Jam Stand mic stand.  When I called more recently about my ts-90b's I also brought up that the Jam Stand was defective.  The rep assured me that they would just send me a new one since it wasn't worth it for me to send in the old one (admittedly it's an inexpensive mic stand).  It's been almost 2 months since the initial call was made where the jam stand was reported as defective, and I was assured I'd receive a replacement.  I have not even received a notice that a new stand was shipped.\n\nSeriously though, no follow up for over a year, and no resolution is simply unacceptable.\n\nAs stated earlier I have a rep who seems to be more proactive and diligent.  I'm hoping she will resolve this situation to satisfaction.  I will update my review after the outcome.  Until that time though, I would strongly recommend not purchasing anything from Ultimate Support."

But it was a pedal board specific issue as far as I can tell since using RP500 pedals XLR out into headphones using this vs. just the actual headphone out both sounded ok, so the cable did what it was supposed but it didn't particularly fit my needs as well as I hoped."

        "reviewText": "Could not figure out a way to clip it to my electric Skyinbow violin. Won't clip to pegs, won't clip to body, so couldn't really use. When I did get it to clip a few times (before it slipped off), I would play the note (with it set to violin) but nothing would register. Then when I stopped playing the note, suddenly the \"A\" or whichever string I had just played would light up, and it always showed a range--never a solid note (and yes, I was in tune). My ear works better than this tuner. A bandmate gave me a Snark, and it works MUCH better and stays clipped to the peg while I am tuning. When I tune, I tune the A, then do the other strings by ear, unless it is REALLY noisy. I double check everything with the tuner, and I am always spot on (and find this to be the case no matter which tuner I use, even an old school tuning fork). So the fact that this Intelli Tuner did not work for me indicates that it is no good. The reviews were good, so I was disappointed that it was a bad purchase.\n\nGo with the inexpensive SNARK. It comes in a little bag you can tuck into your case, it seems to pick up minor tuning differences better, the head adjusts more easily and in more positions. The Intelli Tuner just didn't work as well."

The stretchy band around the post and heavy chrome lever types are too difficult to position but this spring loaded type can be re-positioned with just a squeeze to get away from that buzz or mute that you run into at times or that intonation glitch away from the sweet spot from guitar to guitar.

        "reviewText": "Kyser is one of the largest capo brands on the market, and quite possibly the most popular quick-release spring loaded capo. Professionals and novices use them alike because of their reported easiness and functionality. Because of their reputation, I picked up one a couple years ago to use as an alternative to a micrometer capo. Today, I just about never use the Kyser. Here's why:\n\nFrom day one, the Kyser was always extremely stiff. While it's no secret that the springs on these need a certain amount of use to break in, the spring today is still not much better. When placed correctly, the capo generally keeps good intonation. However, I've found that it often takes several re-positions to get the right sound. The capo works good at capo 1&2, but will almost guaranteed pull the strings out of tune at capo 3 onwards. If the capo is pulling the strings so much as to majorly de-tune them (more than a half-step over time) imagine what it is doing to the frets for wear? The Kyser may be the quickest and easiest capo to change, but the bottom line is that it's tension is alarmingly tight and has the potential to damage the neck over time. If you're working off a cheaper guitar that you don't care too much about, the Kyser is no doubt the easiest and most convenient capo choice. I would by no means recommend this capo if you are using an expensive guitar due to it's tendency to over-exert pressure. Capos like the Shubb or G7th offer you the ability to adjust tension while still retaining much functionality ease. For expensive guitars, I'd spend a couple extra bucks and check out one of those. Happy playing!"

They simply unscrew so you can re-soldier breaks quickly.\n\nOver-all good cable, but be careful. You can easily damage your gear when unplugging."

The strings sounded wonderful while lasted.  Maybe the D-string was defective.  Maybe the high tension has to do with the early demise.  The strings were tuned to just below 440 standard.  The strings were not abused.  This was first trial of the high tension strings, and I liked the result.  Typically it's the A string which breaks most often, but since it was the D string it may be a defectively manufactured string.\n\nThe high tensions set has much better projecting sound and reduction of unwanted wolfs as compared to the medium tension.  It is relatively good set of cello string.  Time to get a replacements and see if it does better"

That being said, I love this guitar.  The tuners work well with virtually no slip.  The action and feel is really nice (you'll undoubtedly need to get it adjusted when you first get it), and the sound on it is pretty bass-heavy, meaning it would probably do well for metal styles.  The pickups are nothing to write home about, which if you're a more experience guitarist, you'll probably swap these out right away - the stock stuff is fairly boring and average.  I get a decent amount of sustain off of this instrument, which is a definate plus.  Compared to some other guitars that I've played, this thing is built like a tank, and a bit awkward to manuver with if in an enclosed space.  The headstock feels perticularly cumbersome, and (again) can make things difficuly when you're moving around in tight quarters.  But none of that has any real bearing on the guitar overall.  But is does feel like you've slung a beast over your shoulders.\n\nThe only downside that I can find with this guitar is how the neck is fastened to the body.  If you're used to hammering away on your guitar, you'll never get a single note in tune - there seemes to be a tiny amount of play in the neck that affects intonation.  If you have a lighter touch, no problems.  So, you're not going to want to be jumping around on stage with this thing wrapped around you...aside from the fact that doing so may actually maim or kill one of your bandmates because of its bulk.\n\nAll in all it is a good beginner to intermediate guitar.  I have no regrets."

In my personal experience, I haven't been plugging into a hot amp or sound system as much as I thought I would be (I still tend to plug in before the power is on, or to be sure the line is muted). More often what has happened is that during a hurried sound check the issue with sending out no signal was simply due to the cable's circuit breaker switch not being turned on. The same thing has happened when others have borrowed my cable and weren't even aware of the on/off function.\n\nSo yeah, it's a good cable, it's just that there can be a bit of an adjustment period."

This didn't end up being a problem for me because the supplied screws were the exact same size as the ones that were already in my Dean bass. The installation was pretty straightforward, just be careful that you don't use a screwdriver with too wide of a shaft. It would have been nice if the instructions had suggested easier tools for getting on the retaining clip.\n\nThere are a couple issues I have encountered. I have found that straplocks extend out just enough to stop my guitar and bass from fitting in the case. Of course that's easily remedied by taking of the strap (which is best to do anyways before packing up), but it's just one more step that can be annoying if you're in a hurry to pack up or get started. Also, I've found that they sometimes rattle a bit when used on my acoustic bass. At some point I'll go in and add some additional padding to remedy the looseness of the fittings."

The ds-1 is a no-frills tank of a pedal; it was designed to withstand a direct nuclear blast as well as Michael Moore stepping on it, so you know it can take any amount of punishment you might care to give it.\n  This pedal doesn't replicate any type of amplifier-it's not a \"Marshall-in-a-box, or a mesa boogie, or a vox, or a Fender; from a tonal aspect it isn't complex or dynamic. It will add plenty of grind to your tone, and plenty of hum to go with it. If you're looking for your first distortion pedal to use with your 15-watt practice amp, look no further. If you have a decent tube amp, look elsewhere, because with this pedal, you get what you pay for, and it simply will not do a quality amp justice.\n  Pros: Inexpensive, good build quality, distorts your signal.\nCons: Lots of hum, the tone control gets really shrill really fast.\n  Without the excessive hum and almost-unusable tone control, this would get 4 stars."

I have tried lots of strings over the years, the phosphor bronze light gauge are my favorites.  I prefer D'addario (I think the feel and sound the best) or Elixar (neat sound and they last a long time because of the coating).  I've also found the Ernie Ball Earthwound are pretty good.  I tried these Martin strings on a whim - mostly because I hear that Martin is a good brand, so their strings must be good too right?  I think the sound is good on the low strings, but not on the high strings.  Also the high strings tend to cut into my fingers which is a problem I haven't had in many years.  I also didn't like the packaging.  Where other strings now come sealed in plastic, with ascending pairs of strings together in the same package.  These strings come in 3 envelopes with every-other adjacent string wrapped together.  So it's a bit more of a pain to install them."

Dunlop having the original and dual design locks.\n\nI have both types on my guitars.\n\nFirst the Dunlop: (all finish types)\nInstallation was simple, screw was replaced with the one included in the package. I had to drill one of my guitars to enlarge the hole, easy. The finish of the lock was O.K. the black suffered the most with some dings and scratches, depending on the shipping and how long the locks were packed the finishing flaws will vary. I noticed it the most on black.\n\nThey feel secure and lock well in place; I still feel they are a bit far from the guitar body as compared to the Schallers. I would recommend the dual design as opposed to the original.\n\nOne big negative is the strap installment; your life could turn into hell depending on the strap ends thickness. And the lock is just not designed to be removed form the strap easily. If you wish to change, wash or replace the strap in the future it is very hard and you could damage the locking mechanism (a metal ring, open locking C washer).\n\nSecond the Schaller: (chrome/nickel)\nInstallation was simple also, straight on. Finish is great; however, metal washer for the strap ends could get damaged depending on what type of tool you use to install the locks on the strap. Use a flat small wrench available in hard ware stores (was not included in the package) I bought them from a local store.\n\nThey fell very secure and are snug to your guitar body resulting in less strain on the lock ends.\n\nInstalling the locks on the strap is a breeze, just tightening the nut with a washer over the strap and you're done. Changing the strap, no problems, easily loosen the nut and replace.\n\nThe only negative is that you could mar the teeth of you over tighten.\n\nBoth are great, however I recommend the Schaller.\n\nSorry for the long review."

I've already outlined below in my original review that these are not Jim Dunlop capos.  I had purchased two, which I have now given away to student players as I cannot use them.  I tested the capos on a standard acoustic and also an electric guitar.  The E string buzzes when the capo is applied and no amount of adjusting the capo would stop the buzz from occurring. Both capos had this very same problem.\n\nWhen I received these capos, I noticed right away that they were not the same excellent quality as actual Jim Dunlop capos.  The craftsmanship was visibly lower quality and the materials used are a lesser quality than official Jim Dunlop capos.  The rubber has a strong odor and there is no brand-name printed anywhere on the product.  As a professional musician, I need to purchase reputable brand-name products because I can't afford to have my gear failing during performances.  I have no idea about the future performance of these capos because they have no apparent brand, and no measurable reputation.  When I contacted the seller, they were not honest with me."

Unfortunately, I can't endorse these strings, even though they sound great and the light gauge saves my fingers. The problem is that they break, in my humble opinion, excessively easily. I put a set on and broke a g string within 2 days of moderate use. It snapped near the saddle, so I didn't think much of it. I replaced the set, and within a few more days I noticed that the wrapping on the g string was broken and becoming unraveled near my third fret. I bought 7 sets, so I still have 5 more sets to go through, but honestly I'll probably go back to elixirs when these are gone, since they seem to last longer.\n\n*update*\nI purchased these strings on 12/19.

After more than 40 years as a serious guitarist, my advice is do not skimp on cables.  Avoid buying those cheap ones. That goes for guitar cables, speaker cables and microphone cables.  The investment in good ones yields dividends not just in tone and low noise, but also in reliability over time.  Cheap cables fail much sooner, so you have to factor in the cost of frequent replacement, not to mention the hassle or embarrassment of dealing with a malfunction. In my experience, Spectraflex cables hit the sweet spot where price and quality intersect."

With that said, no, they are not that good of quality, and there tone is absolutely horrible. But I would still recommend them based on what your looking for.\n\nYour looking at 6 dollar strings, what could you possibly expect? Chances are your either a broke musician, such as myself, or working on a project 12 string and trying to minimalize cost when going into it. For the 6 dollars, and the fact they are eligible for Prime(or super saver shipping) they are worth it.\n\n12 string guitars are expensive to maintain, that much is very true. You need a new bridge from time to time, a sturdier case, and the cost of strings is usually around 20 dollars for a decent set. The problem lies in the fact that very few people play a 12 string anymore for serious music. That makes it incredibly hard to justify spending the extra money on strings. 12 strings now are used primarily for people either recording and looking for a unique sound, or just messing around with one in your local coffee shop. If you are looking to record, go elsewhere. Drop about 15 more dollars and get yourself some Elixirs or higher end Martins and get something that resonates. These sound dull almost immediately out of the package. But if you are in the second camp, and just want something that plays, then these are an excellent solution.\n\nAll in all, I knew what I would get. I did not expect much, and I did not get much. If your thinking you just found one of Amazon's hidden gems though, you did not. What you did find however, is an excellent set of strings for simply playing, either for yourself, or with a group. Just keep in mind that these are cheap strings, and you will not regret the purchase. Happy Playing."

The Kobza has a sort of Cittern shaped body, so the acoustical properties are probably a bit different than the average 12 string."

        "reviewText": "I bought this thing for my Fender acoustic which is my first and only guitar that I've played on for 6 years now. It doesn't have a pickup built into it. As I started getting involved in the worship ministry at church, I needed some way to amplify my acoustic sound. Because I'm a regular bassist, I didn't want to invest too much into a new acoustic-electric (although I would love one). And micing the guitar was nice but inefficient because I move around a lot when I lead worship. So I did some researching and came across this pickup. I took people's words for it and bought it. The pickup works. But it picks up waay too little signal. When I plug it into a DI, I literally have to put the gain up 95% of the way and then crank it up in my monitor to hear my guitar. And because the gain is so high, I get unnecessary noise.  I plugged it into my bass amp and same deal, gotta crank it up real high to actually hear my acoustic. However, aside from the noise, it sounds pretty nice with right EQing and compression. For now, I'm gonna stick to just micing it with a 57. Sounds way better.\n\nSo I don't know if mine is just a dud or if this pickup is just poorly built."

If you look close at the picture, you can see what appears to be some roughness along the sides of the part.  One of the two that came in the package I got was rough like that all over.  There wasn't a smooth, shiny surface on any part of it!  It went right into the trash, because it was unusable.  I only planned on using one of them anyway, so I moved ahead with the other one.\nThat other one had a good enough finish...but the spindle upon which the strings rest wasn't centered!  So, imagine you've got this mounted exactly half way between your E and B strings, but the depression where the strings rest is right up against the side of the guide on one side, and 3/16\" away from the side on the other side!  I at first thought this one was trash, too, until I noticed that the spindle is actually a separate piece pressed into a hole in the main body.  I was able to push that pin back to the center using my vice and a pair of vice-grips.  It wasn't easy, though, because I had to pad the whole thing with leather strips to keep from messing up the chrome plating.  I got it to work, but I'd never buy them again...or if I did, I'd by several pairs, hoping that I'd come up with a couple usable ones out of the bunch."

        "reviewText": "I recently remodeled my office, and decided to hang my many guitars.  I have several on a long piece of Slatwall, and the rest hung up on individual hangers.  I have three of these String Swing hangers, and two each from Hercules and On-Stage.  The Hercules were purchased here on Amazon, and the On-Stage are the brand favored by the local guitar store, so I got them there.\n\nOf the three, my favorite is easily the Hercules.  The wood is the most nicely finished, and the hanger pivots more freely, and locks the neck in place when the guitar is hung from it.  But when I went to order more, they weren't in stock.  Amazon has spoiled me...when I want something, I want it right now, and I could get the others quicker.  The Hercules hangers are also twice the cost of the other two, but that wasn't a factor for me...after all, you're hanging an expensive instrument...who really want's to skimp on the only thing keeping it from damage?\n\nNext, I prefer the On-Stage brand.  I looked for them on Amazon, but didn't find them.  They don't lock the guitar in place like the Hercules, but the yokes are strong, and pivot freely accommodating all types of guitars.\n\nBoth of those two are pretty strong.  Pulling on the yoke by hand doesn't reveal much give.\n\nBut I needed three more for the last three guitars, which I hadn't originally planned on hanging...so I ordered these from Amazon with same day delivery.  They will do the job, but they're not as good as the other two.  First, although you can't see it in the picture, the way these work is that the yolk has a long threaded shaft that goes through the plastic spacer (the part that's shown touching the wood in the picture.  There is also a rubber washer-grommet thing that goes between the plastic spacer and the yoke.  After mounting the base to the wall, you put the washer and spacer on the threaded post and then thread that shaft into the metal thread insert that's pre-installed in the wood.  You tighten the yoke untill the rubber washer compresses enough that the yoke begins to tighten.  If you leave it loose enough that the yoke will automatically pivot to match an odd-shaped headstock (like a Telecaster), the whole thing feels pretty flimsy overall.  When you put the guitar in the hanger, the yoke will sag downward under its weight, and you can visibly see the yoke move...like a quarter inch, or more.  You can also see the spacer sliding against the wood base!  If you turn the yoke another turn or two, so that the rubber washer is more compressed and the whole thing is tighter, it does firm things up a bit, but everything still sags.  If you use them like this, the yoke won't pivot freely to match your headstock...so you either have to turn it by hand, or hang the same guitar in the same hanger all the time.  That's probably how most folks do it anyway, but I'll often move my guitars from one spot to another.  The thing is, BOTH of the other brands have a much thicker shaft, and feel a LOT more solid once installed, while being free to pivot and accommodate whatever guitar is hung from them.  In my case, I've hung my three lightest guitars (two accoustic and one semi-hollow electric) from these hangers.\n\nFinally, the screws they include are too short!  The screws were two inch coarse-thread wood screws.  After you go through the wood base and your drywall, you'll have, at best, 3/4\" of screw into the studs of your wall.  But remember, it's a wood screw with a long tapered tip...so the first 1/4\" isn't holding much.  Also included with this stand are two drywall anchors...the E-Z anchor kind...white plastic with a deep screw thread that self-drill their way into the drywall and provide a hole for a smaller screw in the center.  This is just stupid...for one thing, if you're screwing into a stud in the wall, which you should be, these anchors won't work (and aren't necessary).  For another, while the ANCHOR itself is rated at some super high weight rating, it's the drywall itself you can't trust to hang a guitar!  No one in their right mind hangs an instrument from a hanger like this attached only to drywall.  So, bottom line?  Plan on finding some 2 1/2\" or 3\" wood screws to go along with these mounts, and please don't use the drywall anchors!  To be fair, the Hercules screws weren't long enough either, IMO, and both the Hercules and the On-Stage included cheap drywall anchors.  But again...you're crazy if you hang an expensive guitar from a hanger using only drywall anchors!"

Buzzing and dead strings are common in early guitar play and EZ Chord will eliminate this, but the user is limited to only four major cords which can be used to play many songs included in the mimeographed song sheet that comes with the device. Nice try by the inventors of several devices like this, but its best to struggle a bit with basic chords, notes and scales.  You'll be a better musician for it."

That's still not a problem because I simply put the right angle plug in the amp and the straight plug in the guitar. This cable is far more flexible than plastic coated cables. I'm very pleased with it and recommend it."

It works at least for 6 months. It will amplify your guitar.\nB. It's easy to install and uninstall.\nC. You can send the cable directly to your amp without preamplification.\n\nWhat else is the deal with this pickup? What's not so great?\n\nA. Build quality is so-so. The pickup stopped working after about 6 months. The cork pads that clamp the edges of your soundhole also came unglued after about 6 months. Wear and tear may occur quickly with this pickup.\nB. Cable placement is awkward.\nC. Cable feels flimsy.\nD. Lots of hum.\nE. Seymour Duncan offers a slightly cheaper pickup of the same style. I have not used it as long or put it through the rigor of a season of busking yet. So far it sounds better than the Fishman. It's also easier to install, has less (but not no) hum, and the placement in the sound hole is less intrusive.\n\nShould you purchase it?\nNo.\n\nReally?\nThe Fishman pickup is cheaper than many other soundhole pickups, but you get what you pay for in this case. The sound is too hummy, the construction is bad enough to defeat the device. Go for Seymour Duncan instead. It's not a wonder-pick-up, but it is cheap, it has less hum than the Fishman, and build quality appears to be a little bit better."

I used this amp for about a year.\n\nWhat's the deal with this amp? What's to recommend about it?\n\nA. It's loud.\nB. It has rechargeable batteries. They hold a long charge.\nC. It's simple. On/Off, Volume, Tone, Squeal, Inputs in front and back.\nD. It works, mostly.\nE. It's compact.\nF. At lower volumes the cleans are clean. They will distort when you put the volume knob up, but if you are playing on the street this isn't a huge deal. Precision is less important than volume.\nG. I didn't used \"Squeal\" very much, but it sounded fine when I did.\n\nWhat else is the deal with this amp? What's not so great about it?\n\nA. It's heavy. This is an irritating characteristic, since the point of this amp is its portability. Mind I'm not the strongest person you will ever meet. If you're a strong fellow who doesn't have anything else to carry this may not bother you.\nB. Build construction is so-so. The adhesive on one of the cable jacks came undone, some of the wiring was dislodged, I had to take the thing apart and reglue stuff. The caps of two dials also came dislodged. Annoying, but not a huge deal.\nC. Rechargeable batteries require regular charging and full use/discharging. This may be inconvenient.\nD. There are other amps at this price point worth your attention. I use a Vox DA 5 now which I got for 50 bucks off of craigslist. Previous versions of Roland's Micro Cube can be found on craigslist for 60-80 bucks. These I have not played, but they have a very good reputation.\nE. Hiss and hum.\n\nIs it worth purchasing?\nSure, if you get it used or discounted.\n\nWhy three stars then?\nBecause it's an OK amp.\n\nAddendum:\n\nSide by side comparison between the Vox DA 5 and the Pignose Hog 20. Comparison done with an Ibanez EW20ASNT1201 and Seymour Duncan Woody Series SC SA-3SC Single Coil Pickup. Note: I'm not comparing how accurately the amp reproduces my guitar's sound. I'm comparing how things sound within this configuration. This is a personal assessment and should be taken as such.\n\nClean: Vox and Pignose can both get quite loud without distorting, but Vox stays more consistent as you dial up the volume. Pignose's low end is richer than Vox's. Pignose sounds tighter across the board, Vox sounds warmer.\n\nOverdrive/Distortion: Overdrive on the Vox can be driven up with lots of warm fuzz, Pignose is is much more restrained. You can hear the gain increase on the Pignose, but it's subtle and tight. Vox's overdrive has much more gradation from clean to full overdrive, is warm, is looser. Halfway turned gain dial on the Vox is about the level of distortion/overdrive you'll get on the Pignose with the Squeal dial fully turned. A similar sound to the Pignose Squeal can be reproduced on the Vox by fiddling with the Gain, Volume, Tone, and Effects dials. The Hog 20's reputation is accurate- the Squeal tone sounds suited for blues.\n\nOverdrive and Clean: Vox sounds warmer overall, both on overdrive and clean. Vox has more responsive Tone adjustment. Pignose has richer low tones and tighter overall sound. Pignose is simple, Vox is adjustable, both are loud enough for busking.\n\nNoise: Pignose picks up and amplifies humming/hissing more than Vox. Vox also has humming/hissing, but it's softer at similar volume and gain settings. (Note that the pickup I am using is a single coil cheap-y. It has hum.)\n\nPortability: Vox is 7.72 pounds by spec but my weighing got 8.5. The Hog 20 is 15 pounds by spec, I assume including the power adapter. Without the power adapter I measured about 12 pounds. Vox was weighed without batteries. 6 C batteries weigh just shy of a pound, so expect to add that to overall weight if travelling with this amp. Vox is lighter by several pounds, which can mean a world of difference when you're traveling on foot. Both have carrying straps."

If you're looking for a reliable and sturdy cable for your bass guitar - whether for home use or on the road - then Monster Bass is the one. My last cable was a Monster cable (standard, not bass), and it lasted for five years of frequent use.\n\nPros:\n- Looks and FEELS like a high-quality cable... thick and sturdy\n- Great length at 21 ft. (If you don't need 21 feet, then go with the 12-foot one. But I like to move around when I play and stretch my bass across the room.)\n- Sleek look\n- This might sound ancillary, but the packaging is great! You don't have to take a saw to the package. There are tiny clips around the package to open it easily and get your cable out in a hurry!\n- Angled, so the cable stays a bit more out of the way while playing, and because it's angled it's not always bending, thus leading to a longer-lasting cable.\n\nCon:\n- A bit pricier than your average cable, but then again this cable is sturdy. And you get what you pay for, right?\n\nIf you're in the market for a solid, functional, long-lasting, and nice-looking bass guitar cable for home use or performances that will give your bass the best possible tone quality, then go with Monster Bass. You'll be happy you spent the few extra dollars!\n\nEDIT: 12/13/11\n\nI went to play my bass today, but my cable did not work. I tried another cable, and that one worked fine, so I know it's the cable and not my amp or bass. I've had it for only five months, and I use it only for playing at home - not gigs - so there's no reason anything should have happened to it. It could be a freak incident for this cable, but for $40 that it no longer works is inexcusable. Thus I rescind my 5-star vote and give this cable 2 stars."

        "reviewText": "First off, if you're one of the people who've gotten this to work consistently, congrats and I'm glad you're happy.  There seems to be a lot of good reviews, so good for them.  And it is a great premise, the books/DVD are very well done.  Where it falls short for me is in the actual device.  The plastic 'fingers' tend to drift a bit (they are removable), and they hit each other and mess things up.  But the major flaw is how it attaches to the guitar.  It clamps to the neck on the sides, however, the Chord Buddy needs to stay above the strings (so as to not hit the wrong notes), so it also needs something to hold the top solidly.  But any pressure on the buttons causes it to 'fall' down a bit, making contact with the wrong strings.  I'm going to try to clamp it so this doesn't happen, but with the finger drift, I'm not sure this will work anyway.  One wonders what would have happened if they had used better materials?\n\nUpdate:  figured I'd post this, maybe it will help others.  I had to file some edges of the fingers that were rubbing against each other.  Then, in order to stop them from 'drifting' back into each other, I had to glue them (fingers not removable anymore!).  No biggie for me, as I don't see doing half Chord Buddy, half fingering anyway.  The biggest fix came in keeping the Chord Buddy from tilting down.  I took a rubber band and looped it over the rounded plastic (by the tightening screw), underneath the neck and hooked to the other side.  This gives it enough tension so as to not continually flop down.\n\nWhile it now works, I can't give a better grade.  For this much money, it should work well out of the box.\n\nSecond Update:  I also picked up a copy of Rocksmith.  I would have to say that Chord Buddy makes you feel like you are playing a song (strumming a few chords is all it is really doing).  Rocksmith lets you play single notes and then graduate to more, while also making you feel like you are playing along.  I would have to recommend Rocksmith over Chord Buddy, and it's cheaper to boot!"

The product is actually labeled \"PRO\", although I think that is a rather generous label. But compare this mic system at around $120 (as of my purchase) with similar systems costing $500, $600, and more.  Yes, you generally get what you pay for - and I may upgrade one day to a more expensive mic system. But so far, I am very impressed with the PRO 88W set.\n\nI have uploaded a video review that is hopefully more informative and demonstrative of this system and its performance. Please take a look at it if you have the time, it might help you with your purchase decision.\n\nI plan to use this system indoors and outdoors - and sometimes in harsh environments.  I may do some updates to this review over time, to note (good or bad) how it performs over time and different projects.\n\nProduct information says to expect an average of 8 hours for the battery life. The use of the system requires two 9-volt batteries (one each in the receiver and the transmitter)."

Very muddy sounding, but will add more \"body\" to your sound.\n\nShure: cold-sounding mic, highs better than Senns, some mid-range muddiness.\n\nAKG: overall nice sounding mic.  Problem when you \"push\" the mic, i.e. sing loud.  Mic feels like it has a delay in it.\n\nAudix: very nice sounding mic.  No major sonic problems.  Nice, extended highs.  It's the shadow of the awesome OM-5 ($250+) which is faster and has even better clarity.\n\nMy advice: go with the Audix OM-2, or spend $200+ for an Audix OM-5 or Senn 935.  Both high-end mics sound very similar."

My guitar has a unique heart shaped soundhole, which means I needed to place the pickup at the bottom towards the bridge (since its too small to fit the top of the heart).  Because the pickup only has angled cork - it only fits my soundhole by flipping it around. I didn't think this would be a problem, but it is.  Apparently the pickup is designed to have the low e only one way.  It doesnt sound right when flipped (you cant hear the low strings, and the high strings are way too loud). So I have to return it.  I knew about my unique guitar when buying, but couldn't find any info about whether this pickup could work regardless of which way it was placed in the guitar.  So other buyers who have similar issues need to look elsewhere.  But - I did try it on a normal guitar and it worked great. So if you have one of these, it's 4 star."

It sounded cool in an experimental kind of way, and I may find a use for it some day, but seemed to create noise at the lower frequency notes (...and that could just be my amp) and produced a lot of sounds (at various settings) that I thought were terrible.  As for the effect itself, I just found it hard to use it in a predictable way.  It was fun to play around with but every time I've tried to work with it, I find myself shutting it off to get to the sound I am going for.  I knew it would sound electronic, that's it's key trait, but just found it making things sound muddy, especially with the fuzz setting.  I don't like it's distortion feature at all.  I will continue to play around and figure out if I have a use for it but it will take a lot of effort on my part.  Not the kind of pedal that \"out-of-the-box\" blows you away, but not a terrible thing to have either if you have a niche use for this kind of sound."

Mine also had some nice chips off the metal flake paint. Tone-wise, I certainly wasn't impressed. I took a look at the tube and saw some seriously bad craftsmanship. Yeah, I could replace it I suppose. Too bad my care for this thing is at a minimum. Funnily enough, the tube never lights up. They put a little light in there to make you think it does (lol). In truth, these \"tube\" budget preamps aren't truly what you'd think of as tube. It's a gimmick, and a poorly implemented one. \"Neutral\" appears to be the only setting appropriate no matter what you're using it for, which makes the other options useless. And trust me, they sound awful. I decided to just get another \"budget\" model, the VTB1, on eBay used. You pay for the quality of an item, of course. It can combine solid state and tube together, or have each separately. It can also function as a D.I. for bass. Um, much more useful, don't you think? No, I didn't expect the Behringer to have high marks, but this brand is disrespected in the recording community for a reason: it's just not that good. I returned mine."

As with the other rack sizes in the Gator portable product line (I own a Gator 8U portable also that gets moved with this unit), it makes moving rack gear tolerable by providing wheels and a pull-lever a la luggage designs. It's reasonably durable, though I only move it occasionally -- so far.  My complaint is in the machine tolerancing - specifically the screws provided don't work well when you install the equipment into the rack.  The screw holes don't line up well with the rest of the frame, and the Gator screws provided (they are provided, which is a plus) don't fit well.  I own > 4 of a well-known competitor's 12U racks and I found that the competitor's machine screws worked better, though larger washers are needed. Could be a problem with my particular unit's assembly, but the unit is too big to economically send back. Emails to customer service with Gator were not responded to, though I only tried once. Tip: measure your vehicle to determine whether this unit will fit; a 10U unit could be pushing the door opening clearances unless you've got a van or pickup."

        "reviewText": "To start, I've been playing bass for about 5 or 6 years. I've played Thunderbirds at Guitar Centers before and I've always loved their look and sound, so I decided to buy one for myself. Overall, I love it but it has some drawbacks.\n\nPros: -It's a beautiful looking instrument. The vintage sunburst on the body looks great and so does the distinctive Thunderbird logo. The 'reverse' body gives it a radical, eye-catching look.\n\n-It has a great, deep, rumbling tone. The bottom end is nice and clean and the higher end sounds pretty great too. Out of all the basses I own, I love the sound of this one the most. Its a great sound for rock or metal.\n\nCons: -Thunderbirds are notorious for their weight and tendency for neck-dive, and this one is no different. It's fairly weighty, although not as heavy as some other basses I own like my Schecter Stilletto 5. If you're used to playing basses on the heavier end it shouldn't be an issue. The neck will sometimes dive if you take your hands off the instrument with the neck at a low angle, but if you keep the neck at a high angle before you let go, it usually won't dive on its own. If you play it sitting down, it feels pretty comfortable, but for some reason something about the design of the body always makes my right leg fall asleep.\n\n-THE WORST ISSUE: perhaps in response to complains about neck dive in earlier Thunderbird models, Epiphone have moved the location of one of the strap attachment points. Instead of being positioned on the side of the body above the neck (as it is in most guitars/basses and as it is in the picture) it is now located on the back of the instrument where the neck bolts on to the body.\n\nWhile this has largely corrected the neck dive issue, the problem is that for whatever reason Epiphone decided to make one of the neck bolts extra long and make the strap attachment nub a part of this bolt. After playing it a few hours a day for about 3 or 4 days, this neck bolt ripped right out of the body (fortunately I caught the Thunderbird before it hit the floor). The weight of the bass had caused the bolt to strip it's threads inside the body and slip right out, taking the strap with it.\n\nBesides this glaring issue, I love this bass and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a deep, growling tone for rock or metal.\n\nEDIT: I called Epiphone and they had me send in the bass to be repaired. They moved the strap button to where it is on the picture (above the neck) and repaired the stripped bolt. And...now the neck dives like no tomorrow. Seriously, if you play this bass standing up you can't take your fretting hand off of the neck at all or else it will dive straight for the floor. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.\n\nThat said, I've had this bass for eight months now and I'm still madly in love with it. It can handle anything I throw at it and it looks as beautiful and eye-catching as ever."

To be honest, I was very, very impressed with their feel and handling. I do think they're the best playing strings I've used when it comes to pure playability. Hands down, none better. They were butter-smooth and great for flat picking. But for me it was a trade-off, because I simply wasn't impressed with the tone. I even took the time to try them on three different guitars (all dreadnoughts): a classic maple sides/spruce top, a mahogany back/sides with spruce top, and a maple backs/sides with a nato top. On all three, I didn't like the tone as much as the strings I was using. I really wanted to like them, but they simply didn't have the tone of the medium gauge Martin SPs I normally use.\n\nThis isn't to say they're not great strings that sound different on other peoples' guitars, but I simply didn't like them on mine. I love good projection with rich bass tones and ringing treble for the folk and traditional music I play in our jam group. The Elixirs just lacked the punchy high tones of the Martin strings I use, and the treble sounds tinny vs. the clear ring of the Martins I normally use. To be fair, the bass strings sound great, and aren't much different. I would have to say choose your strings carefully based upon how you're going to use them. I play in acoustic groups, and the Elixir strings just don't have what I need to be heard, in spite of how great they feel under your fingers. If playability is more important than great tonal range, then by all means buy these strings...you won't be disappointed. I'm guessing these would be fine on an acoustic electric, where the electronics could compensate for the weaker treble tones."

I believe I was given a substitute product, since when I ordered these straps, the price was just $1.00, and now they're back up to $4.95 as I write this. I'm really sick of these Amazon substitutions. For what I paid, I won't bother returning them...not worth the hassle.

        "reviewText": "My high rating is not for the quality, but for the VALUE of these inexpensive guitars. With few notable exceptions, (i. e. hand made custom guitars) absolutely ALL new guitars require set up. Any reputable dealer should do some set-up before selling a guitar. Although when you buy a guitar via mail, you're unlikely to receive that service.\n\nBut even with a cursory set up, each guitar will change over time. Wood moves. It will expand and contract. Frets bulge from the neck. Someone will need to do those adjustments and minor repairs. Would YOU risk working on a fine instrument without the best tools and plenty of experience?\n\nMy reasoning is, EVERY kid who wants to play guitar also wants to modify it. I've been teaching for over 40 years. In all that time, almost every youngster or teenager puts stickers on his-her guitars, draws on them, tattoos them, refinishes or carves them! You wouldn't want them to do that to a fancy expensive instrument.\n\nAlso, every guitarist must eventually learn how to work on his guitar: restringing at a minimum, but adjusting action, making small electronic repairs or upgrades. Bolt-neck imported guitars like these (or Squire) are wonderful platforms for learning that craft without fretting about destroying a fine instrument. (Fretting... ha!)\n\nIf your young guitar enthusiast wants to learn re-fretting, that's much easier to do on a bolt on neck with no binding like this. Want to hear the difference between pro-pickups and these inexpensive imports? Swapping pickups is an inexpensive upgrade. Even less expensive is trying different capacitors or potentiometers. Your fledgling guitarists may become a computer whiz kid in the future. Some electronic knowledge and basic soldering skills will give him a \"leg-up.\"\n\nThe fact is, a good guitar technician can make one of these cheap guitars play almost as well as an expensive one. You won't have the bragging rights, but you will have a useable guitar that sounds good and inspires practice.\n\nWith just a few inexpensive tools, any kid can learn to level and dress frets. During that learning process, he will make mistakes, but those are also inexpensive to repair and provide a crucial learning lesson: NO ONE gets it perfect the first time. Only consistent daily effort brings improvement. What parent wouldn't want their kids to experience that crucial life lesson?\n\nIt is no longer speculation, but a well known fact that music lessons improve other scholastic scores because only daily practice improves any new skill. It doesnt matter if that skill is playing rock and roll, or practicing math. Do it every day, and you WILL improve. Learning music helps inculcate that great life lesson. Learning to fix and personalize your own guitar makes that lesson deeply engrained yet FUN!\n\nNO, as-is, this is NOT a great guitar, but it is plenty good enough for beginners to learn with. With a few tweaks here and there, these can be made to play as easily as pro-guitars so they don't hurt young fingers. And if you consider all the other factors in a child's development, these may be a better choice than funding an expensive guitar.\n\nOver the decades, I've repaired, adjusted and modified hundreds of student guitars and taught hundreds more how to do their own guitar work. That is one advantage electric guitars like these have over other instruments. You would not want a kid to mess around with a grand piano or a fine violin or classical guitar.\n\nFurther, the young student can express his individuality, learn to be self reliant, and learn the great lessons of relentless steady effort. Some may think sports provide some of those life lessons too, but with guitar, you don't risk critical injury or regular public humiliation. What could be better for your kids?\n\nThese and the Squire brand guitars are a great positive gateway instrument that brings life-long appreciation for music and craftsmanship. They can be a springboard toward learning electronics, circuit design and even some computing basics.\n\nIf you are clever and know an experienced guitarist / teacher, you or your kids can learn about economics, how businesses make compromises at different price points, and what is REALLY valuable in instruments. You might just learn what is valuable in life too.\n\nTHAT is why I love cheap guitars like these, and this particular model is one of the best for all those noble goals."

The guitar barely fits and there is a weird need to make sure she sits exactly flat or the case won;t close. The locks are flimsier than I expected and closing the case needs precise lining up or the locks will not lock. They seem to be slightly out of true. Unfortunately it's taken me a few weeks of using it to discover all this. Doubt it's returnable now.

I also found the neck part to be really uncomfortable.

Whole genre's of music would be different if they didn't exist.\n\nThe DS-1, is just one of those pedals that thru shear popularity has earned a position in guitar effects history.  Nearly everyone has owned one at some point or another.  Its cheap, simple to use and just fun to fool around with.  It feels like it's been around since the dawn of time, and there are lots of well-known artists that are known to use it.  There are literally TONS of mods out there for it, most all of them are probably real improvements because lets face it...it isn't that spectacular of a pedal in it's own right.  Yes, I have one on my pedal board, but I feel like it robs my squawky strat of bottom end too much (it may be more forgiving with humbucker pickups).  So really the only way I can tolerate the pedal is by putting my BOSS GE-7 after it to boost some of the low end again.  That being done, I find the EQ really cleans up the mess of a mediocre distortion pedal.  I've also been temped to mod it (the keeley mod for one is pretty popular, and public on the internet), as the pedal costs next to nothing, and really whats the worst that can happen?  Who knows, it really could be great!  After all, all those great artists that have one on their board, I suspect they've modded theirs too!\n\n3 stars.  A pedal with potential.  I wouldn't discourage anyone from buying it, but I think without an EQ or a mod, you might not have it very long."

To both hands, the strings felt slightly tacky.  Played fingerstyle, they sound dull, or muted, especially on the low end.  When played with a slide, they sound noisy, as if my left hand muting isn't working all of a sudden.\n\nThat was just the first day!  I hoped they would improve, but they did not.  They continued to sound dull, especially played fingerstyle, as if they were really old.  In fact, that's it, in a nutshell: these strings feel and sound as if they'd been strung on a guitar gathering dust and oxidizing for a year; yet they were brand new.\n\nUltimately, the high E broke, (other reviewers have mentioned strings breaking too).  In the spirit of complete disclosure, I switch tunings a lot (DADGAD, open D & G, standard) and of course this will shorten the life of strings.  But still: these lasted less than 2 weeks.\n\nIt's fun to experiment, but these strings were so disappointing that I'm glad a string broke, to entice me to rid the guitar of them sooner!  For now it's back to D'Addarios; they are excellent sounding and value."

I would have returned this thing but it was cheap enough that it wasn't worth the hassle... I'd have rated it 1 star, but I tried it on my Nikon D3200 (Shoe mounted Shotgun Mike) and it worked out ok. Still a tight fit though (since there's only 8\" of wire)...\n\nI'd recommend anyone looking for a short cable go with a 2' adapter; worst case scenario, you can zip-tie a loop instead of getting angry that it doesn't fit.\n\nAlso, not sure if it's the wire (so this didn't affect stars) but I hear a hiss when recording. Again; unsure if it's the way the wires are stretched out to the max on the DSLR or not (or my shotgun mic)."

This silly contraption might be the ticket if you're a drummer - I wouldn't know, because I'm no drummer, but if you're a banjo owner hoping to use this device to set the head tension on your banjo, save your time and money! Its an absolute joke! This thing ships with two adapters, both of which are completely useless for the 1/4\" or 6-mm OD nuts on either American-made (SAE) or metric banjo J-hooks, so as soon as you receive it, you'll need to head-out to the hardware store or go on-line to locate another suitable adapter, and in all likelihood, you'll probably need to use a file or bench grinder to shave off some of the metal on that new adapter, just to make it work! Here's why . . . the diameter of the male shaft on both of the adapters provided with this lemon is 5.5 mm, and they both barely fit into the square female drive socket (or chuck), which means that the female drive socket on the device is approximately 5.8-6.0 mm in diameter. Thus, it will NOT accommodate a standard 1/4\" adapter (1/4\" = 6.4 mm.). This means that if you want to make it work on a banjo head, you'll need to locate either a 6 mm or 1/4\" male socket adapter, and then grind-off all four edges of the drive shaft until it measures something less than 5.8 mm in total diameter. Absolutely ridiculous! Not this fool! I sent this lemon straight back. Good grief! How tough would it have been for these fine folks to have made the female drive 1/4\" diameter??? Wake-up people!"

The early JCM's at max gain and club gig volume were very crunchy, no insane gain on their own, and the DS-1 pushed it to high gain.  That's how you use these classic pedals . Same with the SD-1 you used it to push crunchy tube amps.  The SD-1 had a softer clip  and the DS-1 has a very hard edge to it. Don't buy these to play on a clean channel or even worse on a Solid State amp.  These are for pushing tube amps over the edge and they do it well."

I suppose that compared to a vintage Boss CE-1 or EHX Small Clone, the tone of the CH-1 is not as lush or liquid (sorry, probably the two most over-used adjectives when it comes to chorus) sounding. I don't think that's the tone the designers of this pedal were going for, though. To me, the CH-1 sounds best for adding a little extra thickness and dimension to clean tones rather than slathering on the chorus effect. The CH-1, in my experience, blends very well with distortion, which makes it a great choice for lead work and getting those cool mid-era Alex Lifeson Rush tones.\n\nI tend to favor a thicker, lusher, more vintage sounding chorus for clean tones. However, this pedal really shines when combined with medium to high gain tones. The tone doesn't disintegrate or get too mushy. The highs aren't icepick bright. I think that's a big reason fans of this pedal love it."

For this application, a rack DI (either the quad Whirlwind rack or the Radial  solution (which I also have in my studio) was inappropriate and would've caused more trouble than the large individuals.  I really wanted the smallest DI I could find and had good luck with RAPCO in the past as a utility players.  I take care of my gear, so I figured even with modest build quality, I'd be ok. I was wrong.\n\n(Regarding features) The live system in which I used the DBBLOX (I bought 4, one for each mono keyboard) is built around consistent balanced stage power, and everything is properly grounded, so I had no issue with the lack of a ground switch.  Monitors are handled at the console and I have no amp on stage, so, I didn't need 1/4\" thrus.\n\nMy issue with the DBBLOX is that after 2 years, only 1 out of 4 are \"as purchased\".  3/4 have needed repair.  Two broke in the same spot (the XLR side, when unplugging/plugging a cable, broke and caused a disconnect to the transformer.  The other, the innards just became loose requiring attention to prevent further breakage/damage.  products with their components rattling around inside are, of course. a concern when you rely on them to get your instrument to the main PA. I have been able to fix them, but, it's still a bad design if 2 out of 4 have required surgery, and 1 was preventatively operated on.  Even after repair, I have taken them  out of service,\n\nAs mentioned at the top, I typically buy either proven rock solid live utility pieces or high end studio pieces, so this experiment was, I suppose, a failure,  All DBBLOX have all been replaced by the Whirlwind DI's I already had.  Even though their size still makes things cumbersome, I am confident that they will work on each gig."

Lastly, Im not fully convinced that the case clears the top of the guitar when fully closed- fully tuned guitar went in, shut it (with slight effort to fully close, but more than I would have liked), and immediately opened it to discover my guitar was slightly out-of-tune.

While this unit may not be the absolute latest and greatest audio interface on the market it has pretty solid support and history.  I got mine about 8 months ago for ~$60 (i think there might have been a pricing mistake!).\n\nWorks well with Windows 7 32 and 64 bit OS.  My only minor gripe is that the minimum number of samples is 128, which makes for roughly a 7 ms total latency.  The built-in soundcard on my HP laptop works down to 64 samples (32 using Jack in Linux), BUT cannot touch the sound of the MobilePre.  Note - using Reaper permits using a WDM Kernel Streaming driver instead of ASIO, which allows a little better latency.  Still, sound travels roughly 1 foot each millisecond, so the total latency is like have an amp about 7 feet away, which is barely noticable.\n\nSolidly built, great for guitar.  The preamp section when using a dynamic mic is a bit noisy though.\n\nWould recommend to a friend."

        "reviewText": "This particular Audio Technica cartridge will suprisingly enough yield very crisp and clear audio quality. Bass response is tight but not overwhelming nor weak. The wonderful thing about this type of cartridge is that it's basically a plug and play set up (just have to tighten a screw to hold it in place with most P-mount systems). The elliptical stylus or tip is designed for better contact with the stereo groove walls in a record resulting in better frequency response and clarity. The user does not have to worry about how much stylus pressure,weight, or anti-skating to provide to get the most from this cartridge;that's the beauty of using this cartridge on a P-mount tonearm instead of as a standard one...This cartrdige will perform admirably when used for regular record listening conditions. This is not a DJ stylus to scratch with as you may damage the needle and the record (\"burn\"). Also, it is more suitable for playing any kind of music except classical or jazz where a high end audiophile cartridge/needle would be needed. Such a high end cartridge and needle would bring out extreme musical detail as well as the ambiance or \"air\" of the instruments. Also, that would allow for better stereo separation as well... This is only a better than average cartridge meaning that you will only get about maybe a little over a year's worth of use from it (if you played one or 2 records a day or every 2 days respectively). That is also the difference between a basic low priced cartridge/stylus versus an audiophile grade one (those can usually go for about 5 years---but you would be talking anywhere from hundreds to maybe thousands of dollars)."

It's not going to perform anywhere near Shure's other two high end audiophile carts with regards to tracking and overall clarity and sound quality...You really get what you pay for with the\n\nShure M92E.

        "reviewText": "Who says you have to spend an x amount of hundreds even thousands of dollars on a phono cartridge to listen to crisp and detailed vinyl/analog playback ? However, words like crisp and detailed are very meager adjectives to describe the musical sonic characteristics of this cartridge (true, the rest of your component system's own sound characteristics come into play, i.e; receiver,amp,pre-amp,turntable,speakers).If any part of your audio system does not have that \"synergy\", then you may notice either slight, miniscule shortcomings from the cartridge or system or both. For those with already a warm or neutral sounding system will be dramatically surprised and awestruck. For those who have just the opposite type of system and also may have an eq inline, you may want to adjust your treble settings. The AT 440ML is NOT a neutral or \"warm\" sounding cartridge---far from it. The upper mids and highs will possibly have your dog running out of the room. It's not bass shy either. Bass is firm  but never muddy or boomy. It reproduces the lows and highs very well. There are no punchy mids (though the mids are reproduced admirably but not accurately). Some critics have said this cartridge out of the box and installed properly is reminiscent of having an inline equalizer and it's frequency knob controls in the \"v\" formation. Stereo channel separation is probably the best these ears have heard over any other stereo cartridge I have had in the past (from the Grado Prestige Series to a couple of high-end Shure cartridges).There is definitely a 3-dimensional sonic imaging characteristic in the AT 440ML (especially noted with acoustic and jazz music). The Audio Technica beats most other hi end named brands to the punch with such wide stereo stage channel separation. I have closed my eyes with headphones on or with speakers and I always hear and experience the \"you are there\" feeling that makes me appreciate records much more than the cold 2-dimensional flat sound of audio cd's. Female vocals have a soft but clear presence. Male vocals are well reproduced. The micro-linear stylus reaches deep into the grooves without carving the vinyl (YES ! a wonderful light tracker that requires anywhere from .8 to 1.6 g of tracking force).This will cut down on the wear and tear of your vinyl collection as well as your cartridge/stylus...\n\nDoes this mean that the AT 440ML is PERFECT and that you have finally reached analog playback nirvana??? Well, that depends on different viewpoints. If you have bought cheap cartridges all your life in the $20 to $40 range, then this AT 440ML will be an audio revelation that will have you realize what you have been missing all this time. BUT, it's only a taste of the high end, audiophile analog world. If you have had other hi-end name brand cartridges (an experienced audiophile) and have paid more than what this cartridge is going for, then from a monetary stance you may have paid too much---that is IF the AT's sound rivals or is reminiscent of those pricier carts. On the other hand, if you prefer the warm, neutral sound to your liking, and possibly don't want to experience ear and mind fatigue from a bright cartridge then do not buy this cartridge. The AT 440 ML is a colored (soundwise) cartridge. You will only become ear fatigued if you are used to more neutral or warm cartridges (this is where you will need to adjust your treble settings). As with most cartridges, the AT 440 ML does require a little bit of \"breaking-in\" period (some say 30 hours to maybe 50---depending on your playback time habits). I have owned the AT 440ML for over a year now and it does get more looser or liquid-like, smooth and sweeter in sound(but not warm or dull) with no harsh or grainy sonic characteristics (sounds like I'm describing a fine liquor or malt shake).\n\nThe last glaring question (probably one of the most important) is whether or not this is an excellent tracker (and this is a two-fold question or concern). Are words beginning with s, t, p, and f accurately reproduced (sibilance)? Yes and no. That honorary distinction would be for the Shure V15VxMR cartridge (which is now out of production and was the last of a dying audiophile cartridge breed to be had for a reasonable price range). With the AT 440ML it's more hit than miss with sibilants. About 85% to 90% of the time \"spitty\" consonants are pronounced accurately with a slight edge or exaggeration. However, there have been a few of my clean records where the letter \"s\" cuts through with that static-like harshness more than once on any given side. One such record I have that proves this theory and shortcoming of this cartridge is  Joe Jackson's Jumpin' Jive swing jazz album (the letter s is tracked harshly with that annoying edgy sound). As for overall tracking quality of the music signal in general from beginning of groove to end, it has that inner groove distortion problem licked (this is where the AT 440ML shows off it's greatest audiophile strength). This is due to the linear contact stylus. Nothing MORE aggravating to a record listener than when a low budget or poorly produced cartridge, while it may sound clear and great in the first few tracks on a record side, but then as the needle goes towards the center, the last tracks suffer horribly (no matter how much anti-skate force you apply)! You will no longer have this problem with the AT 440ML; you will finally find out what you have been missing.\n\nKeep in mind that this deep-groove tracing microlinear stylus by design,in picking up such fine musical detail, will also pick up record surface noise and dirt;That's right, that snap,crackle, and pop from static,dirt, or lint. Majority of micro-linear cartridges will do that as opposed to conical or elliptical styli that sort of tend to almost try to soften,mask or even blend out surface record noise.  Conical or elliptical styli,with their larger \"footprint\" tip, will push dirt and other debris out of the way on the record's surface. They also do not reach deep into the groove and make that much of an accurate contact with the groove's wall as a microlinear stylus does. The microlinear stylus will reach deeper into the groove where there is more accumulated dirt or debris;it's a fact(being a light tracker however, this will not wear out your records as fast as a regular stylus cartrdige would). So, I also recommend using an anti-static brush on those not so pristine records. This is the only other area where maybe it's competitor ,the Shure M97xE cartridge, might come out a little ahead; Shures are well known and admired for their almost quiet record surface noise playback and background !\n\nThe bottom line, with both thumbs highly up, I absolutely recommend this fine cartridge. Period. Especially for a novice to the vinyl world or someone on a budget. I have found it difficult to listen to cd's or any digital musical format since owning this cartridge. In fact, I get bored with cd playback nowadays. There's just no musical \"involvement\".Don't be fooled by the simple black and lavender/purple? colored simple looking cartridge. It's what's on the inside of the body that really counts ! The AT 440ML possesses that bang for the buck quality that is hard to beat and will revitalize your long yearning for super (not perfect) audiophile listening and extract nuances and other fine qualities from your record collection !"

        "reviewText": "Purchased this Amp brand new but it had a faulty reverb tank.  Even at lowest volume and intensity of reverb, a noticeable spring buzz and growling happened at what seemed to be lower tone registers.  Never experienced this before in any of the amps I had in the past ever.  I am very concerned about the workmanship at the California factory.  Although the amp was stamped made in California, there appears to be components from other countries in it.  I'd like to know who manufactured the reverb tank.\n\nTo test the reverb tank, I took it off the amp and sat the reverb away from the amp and put the tank on something other than the cardboard which it was seated on.  Same condition persisted.  Checked all tubes if they were loose as well and same condition.  Springs appeared un-damaged.\n\nNot sure if this was a shipping issue or if defective from the factory..........\n\nUpdate as of 9/26:\n\nReceived replacement (Note this was purchased through Sweetwater and Not Amazon)\n- When reverb engaged at any volume, feedback at any amount of reverb or input level when reverb is engaged.  The Feedback hum occurs with or without\nan input connected and only if the reverb is engaged.........\n\nNow sending back the second and hoping the third will be the winner.\n\nWhat is going on with Quality control at the Fender Plant in California ?????  This is an American built amp and a re-issue of a classic.  Just makes no sense considering I have a Pro Junior Amp and a Hot Rod Deluxe, both made at the Mexico Factory with NO ISSUES.  What is going on ?????\n\nUpdate 10/1:\n\nReceived Third Replacement.  Seems better.  Reverb working without significant noise or Feedback issues.  There is a noticeable small hum when the Reverb is engaged and almost has that same type of hum most single coil pickups have.  Noticed the direction of the amp can be adjusted to minimize.  Outlets are grounded, but this amp is clearly much more noisy than my Hot Rod Deluxe amp.  That amp is plugged into the same electrical circuit and much more quiet.  I guess some amount of noise with the Princeton is expected to a degree since it is all tubes and RF interference can be problematic.  The question now is can I live with some of these issues if I will be recording this amp?  Time will tell.......One thing is for certain though.  If Fender had a chance to make a re-issue that was clearly not hand wired but PCB, then they should have made this amp much more quieter than the original.  Not sure if any of the noise issues were present on the original 65, but this could have been tweaked much more.\n\nCabinet Buzz and rattling issues - Some of the screws were not tight along the cabinet.  In an effort to stop some of the cabinet buzz I checked every screw and it did little for some of the issues with frequencies in the lower B spectrum.  Just insanely awful to have an amp that Is priced as a collectible on a vintage and have so many issue..........Result - Sending the Third back and getting a Full Refund.\n\nI recommend not purchasing this amp.  Fender no longer knows how to produce this amp and test for such defects."

The screws that are used to attach the Straplok to the guitar are heavy gauge and pretty large--there's little chance that these are going to come out.  The locking mechanism seems like it is secure and should require little maintenance.  The only disadvantage of the Dunlop system to Schaller's system is that the the Dunlop sticks out measurably farther from the guitar's body.  Ordinarily, it seems like this should be only the most minor of inconveniences.  On an instrument such as a Hofner \"violin\" bass, though, or any guitar with a strap button on the back of the instrument, this makes it difficult to hold the body of the instrument against your body for support.  Schaller's strap locks might look a little more elegant to some players.  The Dunlop Straplok System is sturdy, should provide a long life of service, and can be found at a better price than several of its competitors.  Recommended for most guitar body styles"

        "reviewText": "This pickup didn't work out too well. Even though I adjusted it to almost touch the strings it still fail to pick up the vibration of the G, B and small E strings. It has a curve to it that puts the ends farther away from the strings than the middle section and there's no way to adjust it enough to get it close to those smaller stings. I've never played a guitar with a curve to the strings that would fit this pickup. It's a very odd and unworkable design. In addition, I couldn't deal with the slight delay that a guitar synthesizer causes when processing the signal. Having the sound come out a split second after I pick the string messes up my timing terribly. Some musicians can deal with it just fine, but I'm not one of those guys."

        "reviewText": "First, let me explain where I'm coming from.\n\nI had a 2006 Epiphone Les Paul that I liked, but it sounded a little muddy. I decided to switch out the pickups for Seymour Duncans - boom! Magic! I think switched out the wire - boom! More magic! Then, I decided I wanted a vibrato (aka tremolo) system on my guitar, so I got the Stetsbar bridge and was happy; it even held tune okay. However, I decided I wanted to get tuners that would REALLY hold it in tune, and I was intrigued by the Planet Waves Auto Trim locking tuners. Big mistake.\n\nI know that no hardware is going to be absolutely, 100% perfect, so bear in mind that I'm comparing these tuners to the stock Grover tuners my Epiphone came with.\n\nTwo main problems with the Planet Waves tuners:\n\n#1. Strings are breaking all the time! I never had this problem before, even when I installed the whammy system. I'm finding myself going through a different high E string every day - and I play in flat tuning, so it should be reduced string tension. The B string is also a common casualty.\n\n#2. These tuners can't hold tune. The problem is most noticeable on low E, but is also an issue everywhere else. If I start a song perfectly in tune after using a chromatic tuner, I find three minutes later that power chords sound awful because low E is flat. I've tried tightening the gears - I've even used a wrench - but there's nothing I can do to prevent slipping.\n\nI get the impression that these tuners were designed specifically for standard and heavy strings. I like light strings, though, and it looks like these tuners simply can't handles 8s and 9s the way they should.\n\nAgain, I know all tuners will eventually slip a little and you need to retune from time to time. With the stock Grover tuners that my Epiphone came with, though, I was only having to tune my guitar once or twice a week. After two months, I just gave up and replaced the Planet Waves tuners with the old Grover ones."

I don't know how DW can call this \"fiber\".  In 2013, when one talks about fiber, one is talking about woven materials that are strong, durable, man-made materials.  While this is clearly man-made, it's neither strong nor durable, in fact it came with a soft spot in it already, likely where someone pressed on it too hard with a finger or thumb.  Dennis Wick makes a far better mute, the DW5531, that doubles as both a cup and straight mute.  While it's more expensive, it's far better made and offers both standard mutes that every trumpet player should have.  If you can't afford the DW5531, but the old standard Harmon J1 Triple Play Combo Trumpet Mute."

I might just part ways with my Prime membership over this one, as a matter of principle. If Amazon can prove it is not intentionally trying to trick people, it has some explaining to do.\n\nI ordered this product because I needed a set of individual 17 gauge strings. Didn't need a full set, just a pack of 17's, which is kind of unusual I realize, but they make them. So that's what I thought I was getting. I never DREAMED I was paying $6.74 for a SINGLE .017 STRING! That is simply OUTRAGEOUS. But that's what happened.\n\nHere is how I was tricked by Amazon:\n\nIn the same order, I first purchased a pack of individual 13's for my high E. D'Addario PL013's in a five-pack for a total of $5.30. That's right, 5.30 for FIVE strings of the same guage (013mm), from D'Addoario. Then I looked for a package of 17's to function as my B string. The first result was this product. I didn't pay close enough attention. Surprise. Lesson learned: while the 5 pack of PL013 D'addario strings cost 5.30, the PL017's that came up as the first search result were NOT a pack of 5, but a SINGLE STRING! For over six dollars. The two strings are not appreciably different, mind you, so the price difference is very misleading. The 17 is not wound, which might justify charging a little more (but not that much more). They are both single pieces of wire made from the same material and produced by the same manufacturer. The only difference between them is four one-hundredths of a millimeter.\n\nDue to circumstances beyond my control, I needed to string my guitar too badly to wait for the time it would take to return this $6.74 piece of wire. I had to eat it. One string for the price of a whole pack. Amazon ripped me off. You'd be pretty stupid to buy this if you realized what you were doing."

You don't compare it to a 2 foot long mic that costs 15x as much and is clearly for professional use.  It's meant for the home moviemaker who is unhappy with the builtin mic on their camcorder which has an external 1/8\" mono mic jack  -- yes, this is a MONO output so it will likely only appear on one of two channels if you put it in a stereo mic jack leaving the other one empty.  You might want to build or buy a dual mono to a single stereo adapter so you can capture audio from 2 mic sources on tape when using this.  It will give you more editing options later when you read your tape + 2 audio tracks into your software.\n\nWhat it does best is replace that built in microphone on your DV handheld recorder that picks up the motor noise and every click of the buttons you press.  It does tend to reject your voice if you whisper to the person next to you, perhaps to adjust the lighting.  The package comes with two mic holders, one for a hot-shoe (no electrical connections) and one for a traditional mic stand/arm.  AT made a complete kit out of this unit.\n\nIt uses a single AA battery which should last for a long time.  Some advice - toss the included battery in your pile and buy a good one that won't leak.  I recommend the L91 lithium AA batteries because of their long life and long storage without leakage.  This is a battery you won't be replacing for a couple years so it's best to put a high quality one in to begin with since you'll forget it.  The L91 also provides about 2x the usage of a normal alkaline battery, but it costs ~2x as much so it works out in the end as a wash.\n\nOne note - the picture shows a nice metal mini 1/8->1/4 adapter but what is included in the kit is plastic and lacks the screw-on threads to keep it from pulling out.  The cable is fixed to the microphone and not replacable like professional equipment, but again it's not at that price point.\n\nUse this and your videos will sound alot better.  The next step up is a wireless mic and receiver package for really long distances.  I have used several of these and they make for excellent tapes of a single subject willing to wear the mic and transmitter.  With the shotgun mic you are ready to go no matter who or what you are recording.\n\nI think you'll be impressed with what you get for your money here."

The neck support is decent and there is about 2\" of space about the headstock.\n\nFor the ABT60E (i.e. with preamp that sticks out a little on the side) it would probably work, but I thought it was too close for comfort and the pre-amp controls seemed like they would get tweaked on the side of the interior padding, potentially damaging the guitar with repeated use of this case.\n\nIn case you are wondering (as I was until I could see one in person), yes, the foam in the bottom of the case is cut out in a Jumbo shape - and that's why it probably will hang up on the preamp controls. Options may include smashing the foam down in that section, OR carefully cutting the lining, pulling it back, carving away enough of the foam to allow the pre-amp controls to slide in cleanly.\n\nOverall, this is a nice case, and at the $115 price point, cheaper than the SKB.\n\nI have an ABT60E, and I ended up buying a Roadrunner Jumbo Case from Guitar center, for $105 + tax. Its a great fit and I liked it the best of everything I tried."

        "reviewText": "SUMMARY - if you want to switch between two instruments into one amp, (like 2 guitars ) this solution is pretty much ideal and works very well. If you are switching between amplifiers, you can find better solutions that will potentially be more noise-free, and potentially safer, but they cost more money. Overall, I really like the A or B, A and B switching layout and functionality. This also uses a 9V battery OR a 9V power supply. Prior reviews criticizing lack of easy access to the battery and lack of a 9V input jack are no longer valid -- the product was updated to add an easy access battery door and a \"standard\" 9V jack so you can easily run from your favorite power supply. And the price is right. This is FAR better than the Boss AB-2 that is in the same price range. It lacks a few features that are especially helpful when using this to switch between amplifier inputs.\n\nPROs\n- Relatively small size while still placing the switches far enough apart you are unlikely to hit both when trying to step on only one.\n- A OR B + A AND B switches\n- Good bright LED's indicating which outputs are engaged -- this is really important (at least to me)\n- Use of 9V battery (as opposed to AAA's or something stupid like that. Who would do such a thing? Boss AB-2)\n- 9V Power supply jack of the \"standard\" variety used on a majority of pedals\n\nCONs\n- Allows bleedthrough of noise from one channel to the other (for instance a high gain pedal on B may bleed noise through to A if the pedal is not turned off)\n- No ability to change phase - can be a problem if using a Fender 2 channel amp like DRRI with inputs out of phase, or two amps with inputs out of phase.\n- No ground lift switch to eliminate possible ground loops/hum\n- No isolation transformer - which can in the worst case result in a shock, or may just result in noise and/or bleedthrough or tone sucking if you have long cables.\n\nMY APPLICATION\nI wanted to use this with a DRRI, (two channel inputs) and put an overdrive or high gain Distortion pedal on channel 1, leaving the reverb and speed/intensity to the clean channel 2. However, when the overdrive is turned on, but the AB is switched to the clean channel, you get a lot of bleed through of the noise inherent from that high gain. It goes away if you switch the pedal off, but that kind of defeats the whole purpose. Also since the inputs on the DRRI are out of phase, the combined signal is a little odd sounding. So this isn't the best choice for my application, although it isn't really a BAD choice...it works to a degree but just has a couple issues. However, I expect I will return this due to the bleedthrough of noise -- the rest I could tolerate but I don't think I can live with that."

        "reviewText": "I went on a uni-vibe comparison mission. I was really excited about this pedal until I tested it. In the end, it was the second worst pedal I tested -- all based on the sound. It's a tone killer. There were some things I really like about it -- but the sound wasn't one of them. The major problem with this pedal is that it performs heavy EQ on your tone -- massively boosting bass and cutting the mid-range and highs out of your signal. This might sound cool in your bedroom, but when you put it in the mix of a band, you will likely get lost behind the kick drum and bass player, resulting in mush. I don't believe this pedal will \"cut\" in the mix. It seems like it was designed for the bedroom, not the stage.\n\nI evaluated the pedal like this:\n\nPROS\n- Small form factor on board, just slightly larger than a boss pedal\n- Standard 9V Center negative power supply, and the jack is located on the back where it doesn't conflict with patch cables.\n- Large easily visible control settings (this is nice.)\n- Can \"toe tweak\" the speed setting, although not as easily as some other pedals - I'd prefer the speed on the right, not left and a flat edge on the knob that I can catch with the edge of my shoe.\n- Quality construction\n- LED \"on/off\" indicator, and indicator is not obnoxious\n\nCONS\n- Boosts bass, cuts mids and highs from your signal (major problem with this pedal)\n- LED indicator does not pulse the speed setting (minor issue)\n\nSUMMARY\nI wanted to like this pedal at $150. But in the end, its massive EQ of my tone just makes it a preset equalizer, more than an uni-vibe, and it is set to \"Mush\". Also, it doesn't sound like a real uni-vibe. A real univibe doesn't modify the tone like that.\n\nSUGGESTED REDESIGN:\n- Flip the location of the speed and Intensity knobs so the speed is toe tweakable with the right foot. Consider a larger knob with a flat edge for toe tweaking (see fulltone mini deja vibe), and possibly relocate the speed to lower right. This is a really nice feature.\n- Correct this circuit to put the treble and mids back in, and stop boosting the bass.\n- With these changes, this would be a great pedal. As it is, its a tone killer. The sound is the major problem here.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\nOther pedals I tested and compared\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nShaky Jimi Vibe -  A steal at $60 -and my number one pick based on sound and features, not price.  A great pedal, doesn't take a lot of space up, standard power supply, good visibility on control knob settings. Does not add or subtract frequencies to the signal or add noise. This is the only pedal in the uni-vibe group I tested that I can say that about and it's why it's my #1 pick. Might have slightly less intensity capability on the univibe effect as some of the others - but seems like enough to me!  Overall I LOVE this pedal at under 60 bucks. Only downsides I see are the LED does not flash the speed rate, and the speed control is top left which makes it hard to \"toe tweak\" with my right foot. Quality seems ok, but time will tell on durability. Some users reported issues - but at this price, you could buy two and have a backup, and you would still save $60-80 over the price of most uni-vibes.\n\n- Fulltone Mini Deja vibe -- highest quality construction (as expected at $200). The large knob in the lower right corner for speed is great and allows toe tweaking -- very useful on a vibe pedal. My complaint is that this vibe colors my tone - it boosts the mid range tones while maintaining the crisp highs and slightly losing the bass. This probably helps the sound stand out in a mix, however, I'd rather that my vibe not provide EQ because when I switch it on or off, I don't want to have to compensate at my guitar tone knobs to try to get back \"my sound\". I was able to match exactly an authentic original Uni-vibe sound with some adjusting. It seems to kind of muffle the pick attack or compress it also. I have a love-hate relationship with this pedal after about a week of testing it. Some days I hate it...but I like the build quality and the speed control. I originally liked that it was one of only two pedals that didn't strip the treble off my tone -- until I realized the mids were boosted, the bass was cut and the pick attack was somehow tweaked. Mixed bag, and at $200 shouldn't be.\n\n- Dunlop Uni-vibe -- Cool stainless steel construction. Knobs were hard to see settings. placement of vintage switch on the back of the pedal was easily forgotten at worst and awkward at best. Non standard 18V power supply takes double slots from my power supply brick. Sound was very good but did also color my EQ sound by boosting the bass, and muffling the mids and highs slightly. On the one hand, this sound matched a lot of recorded uni-vibe sounds I've heard. On the other hand, once you strip the treble its hard to put it back in the mix. The seller had a 3 day return policy (3 days??!!) so I returned it and they lost the sale. Othewise, I would still be thinking about this one. I was on the fence about whether it was my winner. I was able to match a true uni-vibe sample, but the treble was slightly lacking and bugged me. At $220 I'd have to love it to keep it. This pedal also offers the ability to add an expression pedal for about $70-80 more. I wish more others had that option.\n\n- BBE Soul Bender - My least favorite Vibe. It had extreme muffling of mids and highs, heavy boost of bass. In a band mix, I'm pretty sure it would get totally lost. At home, might sound ok. form factor was good, controls were simple, I think it pulsed the speed. My recollection is it had an overly bright blue LED. It was the first vibe I bought, and I only compared to Fulltone and Dunlop before returning it. Had some useable sounds, but with the intensity above 50% had an annoying \"womp womp womp\" of a bass note that was not coming from my guitar -- a weird defect in the effect sound in my opinion. With intensity below 50% it was usable...kind of. But a tone muffler. I returned this one early.\n\n- Dunlop ROTO-Vibe : A good choice (perhaps the only choice) if you MUST have expression pedal controlled speed adjustment. Didn't color the tone - and that was a problem on most other uni-vibes tested. Limited speed range and awkward controls placement were most annoying to me. Intensity range seemed less than other pedals too. Large footprint if mounted on board, but also offers the ability to take NO space on the board by not mounting it. I didn't like that when you switch the effect on, you are automatically at high speed due to the mechanical nature of the design. Some awkwardness in the placement of controls and power plug vs guitar cables when plugged in. Std power supply a plus. LED indicators good and flash the speed. Durable construction although the mechanical nature means in time something will need lubricating and you may need to replace internal gears or pots. Overpriced 1.5 to 2X in my opinion.\n\n- Other general modulation effects. Univibes are effectively a phase effect - without the swooshy space-age edge on the sound. You can probably modify a modern phaser pedal to get the univibe sound which is like a vibrato plus analog chorus combined. A modern phaser is close, a modern flanger is much too space-age sounding. Vibrato pedals can capture the vibrato aspect of a uni-vibe and I'd recommend the behringer vibrato at $25 if you like vibrato sounds. uni-vibes are normally used for their \"chorus\" setting, not the vibrato setting. Didn't care for the Behringer time machine.\n\nMy gear used for testing: Fender American Deluxe stratocaster. Mesa Mini-rectifier amplifier, Mesa Rectifier 2x12 cabinet with Celestion V30's. Pedal train pedal board, voodoo labs pedal power power supplies.\n\nA NOTE ON VENDOR SELECTION\nI had a very bad experience with the vendor I bought my MXR/Dunlop M68 from, and while it does not weigh at all on my review of that product, I provided a separate star rating on the vendor feedback page. I recommend if you choose to purchase that pedal (or anything else) you be careful to avoid the Amazon Marketplace vendor called MixDSPnet in San Jose, CA. In addition to charging a 15% restocking fee if you want to return the pedal (in original condition with all materials and packaging), getting them to even acknowledge the return request at all was a problem and took over a week and finally opening a claim with Amazon to get any meaningful response. Once they did communicate, they were very unprofessional. Further, when the product was shipped back signature required (as recommended by amazon), they were \"not available\" or refused to sign for it so after several weeks of attempting to return the product, it remains **unrefunded** despite their confirmation that I could return the item for an 85% refund. I expect I'll need to work further with Amazon in the end to get this resolved. A google earth view of their addressed explained it all. MixDSPnet appears to be running out of an apartment complex. Most Amazon marketplace sellers are just fine but this one is really not, at least when it comes to returns. Also, while they sell a few Dunlop/MXR guitar pedals, looking at their site reveals it's not their primary business - they seem to sell a bunch of other non-musical widgets. My recommendation is that you find a vendor who is in the musical instrument business and who will provide the typical no cost refunds for 30 to 45 days as most large musical instrument retailers do, should you need it. They have a few hundred positive transactions, so maybe can be OK but I can only comment on my experience and this was the worst online transaction I've ever had shopping on amazon."

        "reviewText": "This is a fine guitar, but it isn't amazing.  My particular instrument has some issues with the finish in a couple of places around the perimeter of the guitar - they look like black splotches underneath the sunburst paint and clear-coat.  There's one near the top strap post and another near the place where the pick-guard mounts to the underside of the body.  Neither would be apparent to someone who wasn't appraising the guitar, but they are there and don't look normal to me.  Maybe I got the first one off the line after they switched from black-painted models?  My guitar also has a weird V shape on the back of the neck where the wood grain doesn't match at all - I'm guessing that it's a joint that has been glued together.  I know that the better Les Paul guitars have a one-piece neck, and since I didn't read about this one having something different, I assumed it would be the same.  Glue is stronger than wood and Les Paul guitars have a tendency to break in that area, so I guess my guitar should be more durable than some. Still, it was a disappointing and unexpected discovery.  I'm not sure that seeing these finish issues before-hand would've dissuaded me from buying the same guitar, but upon reflection it would've been much smarter to visit a music store and examine the guitar before buying.\n\nMy remaining issues with the instrument have more to do with the general design of all Les Paul guitars versus my particular instrument.  The guitar is too small for me to comfortably play it without a strap, even while sitting.  The top strap peg is angled up slightly, where guitars with horns have them angled down, which means that investing in the install of a straplock system of some kind is a good idea with a Les Paul - the pegs just don't stay in the strap holes as well as on some other guitars.  It's great that this guitar has all the knobs and switches that \"real\" Les Paul guitars do, but from a practical standpoint it is rather cumbersome to have separate volume and tone knobs for each pickup.  The range of adjustment on the saddles is pretty small, and I found it impossible to setup the guitar for coated .09 strings without additional hardware.\n\nThe guitar sounds decent, it looks pretty great (although not quite as pretty as the pictured one), and due to its shorter scale length it is a tad easier to play than some other guitars.  Note: the shorter scale length is characteristic of Les Paul guitars, it doesn't indicate that this is less than a \"full-sized\" guitar.  Though this is a fine guitar for the price, I'm not sure that I would make the same choice if I were in the same position again."

You have to work with it to get it to stay because the gooseneck can't support it way up above it's clamp too well. The actual pop filter is really heavy it's not cheaply made. In the studio I just use another mic stand just for this pop filter and come in from above with it and let it hang down in front of the mic and the singer."

It is such a good looking little guitar and I really wanted to like it, but mine had fret buzz right out of the box and just did not have an attractive sound, more like a banjo than a guitar. Of course , for the price, I'm not sure what I expected. It's great for practicing chords and picking and such, but not too good for listening. I ended buying a baritone Uke for the same price that sounds awesome and is even smaller, so that is an option to consider if ya don't mind using 4 strings rather than 6. Anyway, I definitely would pass on this one and maybe buy a parlor size good sounding guitar or a Uke if you really want to go small."

It's a really good investment of such a low price to prevent my really expensive instruments from falling on stage as my straps used to slip off occasionally. The reason for 4 stars is because it's a little hard to get them installed on your strap depending on the thickness. On my really fat strap it took two of us to squeeze the two washers hard enough to be able install it, while on my thin strap there was a lot of space between the washer and strap so I had to wrap it with something to stop it from wobbling around (I used fishing line).

I had a cable with the standard Neutrik/Switchcraft-type ends fail on me, and this cable was supposed to be either strain free or simply designed for long life because of the strain of usage.\n\nIt worked great for about 4-6 months, and then broke. It happened so quickly (the trad types seem to take longer) that I swore it must have been the output jack on my guitar. After confirming the guitar was okay, I tried a shorter cable, which worked fine.\n\nD'Addario does offer lifetime replacement, but it puts you in a bit of a bind - you need a backup cable while you are waiting for a replacement, and you have to pay return shipping of the defective cable out-of-pocket. You also have to get R.A. Taken altogether, this makes it a deal breaker. The extra costs essentially make this cable as expensive as something that has a track record of lasting for years. In my case, I bit the bullet and did what I should have done the first go-round and got a really nice DiMarzio cable.\n\nAgain, this cable SOUNDS good while it works - capacitance with the longer cables can be an issue. The good news is that IMO high price is not a guarantee of ANY cable sounding good. The replacement DiMarzio is another example of one that was at the top of the list with cable comparisons. I don't get into the mojo or intangible aspects that will typically find someone paying much more for a cable, but I want durability and published capacitance that is within a certain range. This one meets half of those criteria, but it gets expensive because of the potential to fail sooner rather than later. Well, expensive relative to a cable with an initially higher price but longer lifespan.\n\nSo the replacement that Planet Waves sent me is now the backup, and is still in the original packaging. I figure I'll use it only for short periods while replacing my main cable, so it should last a long time in that situation. If I have a few $ for the shipping and D'Addario is still honoring the lifetime warranty if/when the 2nd one breaks, I may get it replaced. More likely I will just chalk it up to a learning lesson and toss it. Even $4 shipping is a decent percentage of the cost of a more durable cable - IMO it should be set aside to fund its eventual replacement.\n\nIf this cable would have last 1.5 to 2 years, I'd probably give it 5 stars given the price. And if D'Addario took away the warranty thing, it would probably re-shape the customer's perception on what something at this price should cost, because it's a wear item, plain and simple. IDK how much R&D it's worth their trouble to put in something at this price point, but that's is what I would shoot for - a realistically acceptable period of trouble-free use w/no warranty as the trade-off. That would NOT make it a deal breaker."

Using different types of cables had caused significant buzz coming out of the board's AUX (line-level) outputs. We had the same problem with a Canon XA10 in another venue, but had used a DI box to convert the TRS 1/4\" output to XLR while cutting the signal down to mic-level. However, the Panasonic doesn't have an XLR input, so we thought we would need this cable to go out of the DI box & into the camera. To our surprise, we could connect it to our mono output on the board (after cutting down the signal strength with a small knob next to it on the board) & run it directly to the camera without having issues. We don't have the flexibility of making a separate mix through one of the AUX outputs, but we also didn't have any AUX's to spare.\n\nIt's a long explanation, but hopefully it will help someone, whereas it took me many hours of searching online for an answer. i highly recommend this cable & will start using more HOSA's in the future!"

Reasonably priced\n\nMy criticisms:\n1.  The hard plastic does not give at all.  Strumming seems to produce more of a \"picking\" sound rather than a smooth tone on steel strings.  If you normally hold your picks firm, you will need to lighten your grip some to get a smooth strum.\n2.  I normally use nylon picks and I'm not sure if nylon is porous, but with the hard plastic on these stubbies, I could feel the oils from my fingers build up on the pick.  Not a big issue but something I've never noticed with regular nylon picks.\n3.  Pinch harmonics require you to hold the pick closer to the tip and I found that this becomes a little more challenging with the stubby tips.\n\nI purchased these to experiment on my tone.  My guitars either have 9s or 11s strings, and these felt good on the 11s.  Not so much on the lighter strings.  Bottom line, plectrums are a personal choice and after using these for several hours, I always found myself returning to my old picks.  I may give their nylon version a try."

I purchased a few DI's along with a bunch of Whirlwind cables and a Whirlwind snake to put my band on the road in my younger day. Most of these Whirlwind products survived 4 years of full time rock band road work in the most demanding environments imaginable.\n\nAfter those hard touring years the DI then survived everything form full time club house PA  ( 6 nights a week) to a Church environment in its later life and all I can say is Whirlwind stuff for me has a 99% still working score after almost 20 years. Thats amazing!\n\n17 years and I only lost one DI (has a slight hum, never tried to fix it) and one cable got squished in the trailer door but still works! I do not think you can kill a Whirlwind!\nWith that in mind I do highly recommend this DI for solid longevity.\n\nHowever, when I was a house Sound tech using this DI on a bass guitar... like I had done for years, I had a touring band plug-in a much more expensive brand tube DI and I was amazed at the difference. Was if the bass had an extra octave of low end or as if I had added a few 18\" subs! I could not believe  what I was hearing as the walls in the club were shaking more than normal with the kind of low end you feel; the Whirlwind did not do that.\n\nI realized then this DI was missing something. Kinda made me sad as I thought about all the years I could have had so much more low end had I only upgraded my DI box as I had a killer PA rig. But keep in mind I am talking a big expensive PA system in a big room, not your normal club rig.\n\nLater in my carrier I also had an artist drop over for a live show and use her much more expensive passive DI (6x the price of this IMP2)  that featured Jantzen transformers with her Martin Acoustic guitar. I was blown away with what I experienced as the sound was so lifelike...Overtones to die for as those kinda sounds get lost with the IMP2 ,IMO.\n\nWith that in mind I find the Whirlwind to be as solid as a tank however if you are using a high end PA system or critical recording in my opinion you are only as good as your weak link and have better sounding options but at 6x to 20x ( or more)  the price!\n\n I am a full time sound tech and an audiophile nut so I hear the differences of upgraded DI boxes , tubes, cables and such but if you play high end Guitars and tone and sound is everything to you don't skip on your DI and cables.\n\nHowever, with the low price and reliability of  this IMP2 makes this the DI to buy when looking at budget DI boxes.  if you are on a tight budget and a road dog working rock band living in you van this Whirlwind DI may be the one to buy as it will outlast just about anything you own but keep in mind when you get famous and get that record deal remember to upgrade your DI ( as tone is EVERYTHING IMO)  but always keep this Imp2 DI in your gig bag as you will be assured to always have a DI that will work no matter what you do to the thing!"

You can also use it as an extra hand if you do set up work on your guitars.\n\nI also have the Planet Waves plastic capo.  I usually keep one of those in the case as a backup.

I can see this thing eventually losing tension in the pick holder wedges and dropping picks."

I used to use them when playing in a loud rock band, and never had any issues.  They are very comfortable, and easy to control.\n\nNow the bad: the sound.  Not the sound of the plucked not itself, but the hard plastic of the pick against the string makes a very noticeable \"plinking\" sound that is audible through your amp.  If all you're playing is loud music, this may not be an issue.  But I essentially stopped using them when I started playing in a different band with more dynamics, because during quieter passages the plinking sound of the pick on the strings is VERY noticeable to me.\n\nSo, too bad.

Upon opening the box and inspection of the instrument this is what I found: missing screws on the pick guard; the metal piece that covers the strings on the body was freely floating in the bag with the mando and scratched up the back side of the body; the strings were slightly rusty; after setting up the bridge (not too hard with youtube handy) and tuning the instrument, the bridge actually would move around.  The sound was alright, not great.\n\nTo make things worse, I requested to return the defective product through the company (or exchange, but company said must return per Amazon policy and reorder, no problem) I still haven't heard back about getting the return label.

THIS STAND IS POORLY DESIGNED, MADE OF CHEAP COMPONENTS, UNSTABLE, UNSAFE, AND SMELLS *** REALLY BAD ***.\nI wasn't expecting much at this price point but figured Id at least get a basic functional stand suitable for home use.  This stand however isn't even usable.\n\nFirst, it doesnt bode well when the first thing you see when opening the box is a PROP 65 sticker. That tells you right away the product contains cancer causing chemicals or substances. That reason alone is enough for me to return it.\n\nSecond, did I mention the HORRIBLE SMELL? This stand smells of acrid chemicals. So much so it gave me an instant headache.  My sense of smell is somewhat diminished and to me it was VERY strong. I can only imagine what it must smell like to a person with a normal sense of smell. I bought the double pack so it was double the odor.  I cant believe that with the over 1400 reviews that people aren't mentioning the smell. This cant be an isolated incident. I shouldnt be expected to smell that for a few weeks while who knows what chemicals off gas.\n\nNow about the stand itself. The thing is made from cheap lightweight materials. The design is very unstable.  The rear leg is only 3  long and allows the stand to tip over way too easy. Theres no way Im putting any guitar on it.  For comparison, I have an older Peavey stand and the rear leg on that stand is over 6 inches long.  The nut and screw assembly for tightening the upper yoke to the stand base is a loose fitting pressed in thing that just spells trouble down the road.  The lower yoke that holds the guitar body just slips through a hole punched in the tubing.  No support pieces help to stiffen up the area where the yoke passes through.  Again another area that spells trouble.\n\nI bought these stands based on overwhelmingly positive reviews for this item. I cant believe 69% of people rated this 5 stars.  SMH, I wonder what stand they were talking about because the ones I got are total junk.\n\nDo yourself a favor and avoid these at all costs.  These are being returned and I'll order a different brand and style."

For just another twenty dollars one can easily purchase an entry level full size guitar from Fender or Gibson that will do the job and is much better quality.

I had them in my string box for a while, put them on my Les Paul and have been trying to play them. The slickness I don't mind. They feel more slippery, fine. On the wound strings, they're quiet like flatwounds. They look nice. Sound OK, a little different yet good overall. But the plain strings have a sort of polished stainless steel quality to them and seem like a totally different alloy from the customary nickeled steel. My big problem is that these 9s play more like 10s. They don't bend like 9s. It's too much work for me, hard on the fingers. There's also a peculiar unyielding feel at the point of inflection. It's like reaching for my love's hand and encountering a mannequin's.\n\nWhat could be happening? I checked with a micrometer. The thickness is correct.  What if the alloy were heavier? Then for a given gauge and length, they would require more tension to come up to pitch. It has to be something like that. No lacquer on a plain string could withstand the shearing against the frets. Stainless steel's density is 8.04 while plain steel's is 7.85. That would raise tension from 5.6 to 5.8 kg. They also feel like you'd think a \"spring steel\" might feel. I don't believe I'm imagining it. And I don't like it.\n\nSo, if you're expecting these 9s to bend like 9s, I can't recommend them. If you're looking for the feel of 10s, maybe try the 9s, they may suit you just fine, and last forever. Since they don't offer a lighter set, I'm out of luck. They could be harder on your frets, the way stainless wears frets faster, but that's conjecture. What I do know is that they're stiff, and I like supple. They don't deserve a one star, they seem quite well made, but for me they just don't work, so it's wasted time and money."

The 10\" speaker seemed like an advantage (especially for bass) over several in the same price range with 8\" speakers. The first surprise was that the assembly resonated around the low A of a bass, even at quite moderate volume. We're not talking about gigging level. Hard to say if it was the speaker, the cabinet, or something loose inside. The second and almost simultaneous surprise, when I started playing guitar, was that the dog was clearly suffering, and began howling. The third, a little later, was that my wife, who's very tactful and wouldn't complain, went to the bathroom and gobbled a xanax.\n\nIt's a simple solid state analog amp. It behaves well and predictably with pedals and stomp boxes, and you can somewhat control distortion with the guitar's volume pots. In the good value for money column, it is a loud little bugger. If you can get up to 6 on the master knob without the neighbors coming over with pitchforks and torches, you're probably living in the woods. I wouldn't try that with a bass unless you want to shred the paper speaker cone. But above 6, another surprise: nothing much changes.\n\nThe tone is a lot like one of those early \"advanced solid state\" Fender amps that made people return to tubes. Sizzzzling. Remember those Fender amps with the shiny aluminum front panel? A lot of unpleasant harmonics develop as soon as you overdrive it. Basically a square wave running into a high slew rate power stage. That explains the dog, and the wife. It's perfect for one of those \"plants die from loud rock music\" science fair projects.\n\nThere's a VERY GOOD clean mode, and a little button located invisibly that switches to overdrive mode with its own gain and volume knobs, so you can set levels separately. A foot switch can be used to switch modes. There's a spring reverb effect that sounds choppy. And that's it. But when I say \"clean\", I don't mean \"bluesy\" or \"jazz\". I mean electronics, it's just a power stage. And it's unlikely to get a pleasing tone on overdrive, especially at low volume, where at best it sounds like a fuzztone. That's how solid state works, and why most guitarists went back to tubes. You would have to use external pedals/boxes, which sort of defeats the idea of simplicity. As a standalone practice amp, it's like getting a (hot) stick shift pickup truck where you wanted a sedan.\n\nNow, I can understand that some people like it simple and hate computerized stuff because they don't \"get it\", others because they do, but have had enough techno-headaches. OK, so the Frontman is simple. But it's just not a nice-sounding circuit when you push it into saturation. So you'll NEED those not-so-simple external boxes that belong more with a performing setup. If you already have 'em, the Frontman WILL work VERY WELL for you, as just a clean power stage. Do you need a low-medium power stage?\n\nI wanted something portable, self-contained, with living-room or coffee-shop power, AND that sounded good on its own at bedroom volume. I found that if I was willing to sacrifice a little in the wattage column, one of the more modern programmable \"modeling amps\" like a Mustang, with a little trial and error, could sound more like what I wanted WITHOUT requiring external boxes, and for the same minimal cost. In fact, feeding one of those modeling amps into the house PA is usable for performance. The Frontman aims at a middle ground that IMHO is increasingly irrelevant. It went back."

But then it stopped working -- the back leg would no longer lock, so the stand couldn't support an amp.  I emailed the company for help and someone called.  She sounded familiar with the problem, and said that they could mail me the needed part, if I could drill-out a rivet, replace the part, and then use a rivet gun to put it together again.  I don't have a rivet gun.  The only alternative was to return the stand to the company on my dime -- about $13 -- so they could decide whether it was a \"manufacturing error\" such that it was \"within warranty.\"  Even if it was, she said, they would not reimburse me the $13 shipping.  The uncertainty, delay and cost is too much.  I'm throwing the stand away and buying one from another company.  This is not the \"ultimate\" amp stand.  It's not even a good one."

The sound is bright, but lacks a fullness found with some of the heavier strings such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Martin-MSP4150-SP-Phosphor-Bronze-Acoustic-Guitar-Strings-Light-Medium/dp/B000A2HOB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Martin MSP4150 SP Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings, Light-Medium</a>.\n\nThe custom light are easier to play and have a bright tone to them, but can make a guitar sound like a cheaper model compared to the Light-Medium. Some disadvantages to the thinner strings are that they can limit your dynamics. If you strum harder, they are more stretchy and the tuning will be less consistent, changing the tone for the same reason a \"bend\" would. If you play at a fairly consistent sound level you can expect more of a bright sound than a resonant one.\n\nOn the other hand, compared to some other brands with more of a dampened sound, the brightness can make an instrument sound quite good.\n\nDepending on your style, these might be a good choice. If you are used to playing a solid body electric with a lighter feel to the strings that make medium strings uncomfortable, these might seem more at home.  If you are used to Martin medium strings, but want something that you can play for a few extra hours a day without feeling as if you are overdoing things, you might like these too, but when you pick up a guitar with the Martin Medium strings, you may find that even a cheaper guitar sounds better in comparison to these on a more upscale one.\n\nI wouldn't say I dislike these, and I wouldn't quite say that those who gave it five stars oversold them, because they may deserve five stars for your particular needs. But as an all around choice, there are better sounding ones from Martin. But it's a moot point if you don't feel comfortable playing them. Make sure to read a variety of reviews before deciding because there are other equally valid viewpoints just as each player is unique."

I just mean, if you are serious in trying to learn guitar... do not.  These things are always overly cheap and unplayable.  I have a few cheap models of Silvertone guitars that are for display purposes only (signed by artists) and, trust me, as a guitarist who owns many guitars, I cant even play these things. They are so cheap, the strings do not stay in tune, usually have intonation problems (cant clear frets and thus buzz and pop or never have proper note frequences at all the frets).  They usually always feel cheap too and the feel does affect the playability and tone.  If you want to really learn you have to pay at least a little more and go for better brands.  I would recommend anyone serious in learning to never buy a guitar that costs under $300... you are just wasting your money and the problems and limitations may even frustrate you and work against you learning how to play.  Go for the brands that are made by the bigger dogs... like ESP's LTD brand... Gibson's Epiphone brand, or Fender's lower brand (Squire?).  There are other examples.  I am sure Ibanez has some good lower models (though I am not sure they have a lower brand name for their cheaper gear).  If you do have to go for a cheaper brand, at least then buy their top of the line models (this pertains to Dean, for example).  But for me, brands like Silvertone and Archer... are just plain no good for real use."

The part that fits over the tuning knob is a fixed width and it does not fit over the 5th-string knob of my Deering banjo. The knob is just too thick. It also has a tendency to slip off the knobs that it does fit over. It would work so much better if the part that slips over the knob were made of a soft, flexible, grippy material or if it were at least adjustable"

I don't know why there are so many good reviews for this amp as the speaker and casing rattle so much you can barely hear the tone. Even at low volumes the farty buzz is overwhelming and extremely unpleasant.\n\nThe vinyl wrap is so cheaply applied that right out of the box it is starting to come off and touching the speaker. I thought maybe they shipped me a defective unit but the replacement I got is just as bad. If you're looking for something portable to play bass with, avoid this at all costs."

While it is possible to buy a $130 guitar that is o-kaaay, you still need a luthier to set it up.

I ran out, and had a set of the Marquis laying around so I put them in my guitar.  What I like about the SP strings, the Marquis are not.  I have to say that I would not fault anyone for using these Marquis strings.  It's a matter of preference.  I like the SP's for: volume (they project pretty well), the awesome tone.  I would say the Marquis are more \"subdued\" or \"refined\" sounding, compared to the SP's. They have a nice sound but it seems like it's an attenuated or equalizer-flat version of the SP strings so everything I like in the Marquis is way better in the SP's.  In a sense, the Marquis are quite possibly more \"accurate\" sounding, compared to the SP's which are comparatively amped up.  All being equal, I can't imagine why anyone would choose a quieter string over a louder or better projecting one, but it may suit some people's taste or guitar.  I hope this helps people make an informed decision tailored to what they are looking for.  As for me, I will be using the SP Martins from now on.  I've tried many and have not found the strings that cost double or triple to be any better, and quite possibly not even quite as good."

I turned 60 Time became an issue .sold GR-33 bought almost $500 more GR-55. within one month realized what a disappointment. It was too many sound in each group you had to constantly edit . Sold half price only 4 month old just the unit, buyer was a bass player who told me people don't need your pickup GK-3. I guess what they use is Gk-3B for bass. Buyer got a good deal because I by mistake send my Roland cable . but he told me to try GR-20 . He was right easy really no need for manuals. I used a goodin guitar. I mostly play nylon string. It is well built but input jack 13 pins was acting. BE Aware If you have goodin brand new buy an extra unit circuit board with both 13 pin and 1/4 jack because if your 13 pin acts all Godin reps only want to sell guitars not repair or parts. The local  guitar repair shop decline to install a new 13 pin input jack and told me godin them self can't fix it .So far I tried to give some of my experiences to those that are new to this . I install around 12 of these type Pick ups, the last one was an Axon 101 pick up. THIS PICK UP WON'T WORK ON YOUR NYLON STRING GUITAR. That is why I mentioned Godin because you can play 13 pin with nylon string. If you are into guitar synthesizer to play moon light Sonata Piano sound using your Guitar think again. but it is very handy if you are one of those people who likes to right his/her own piece. If you are young and eager go for it . Axon is better although no longer is made specially when the latency is an issue the sound board is no match for Roland controller . This is a good pick up with a part for Les Paul type bridge. but I rather use guitars with single saddle . you see a tiny L shape  part which is 1 mm. this is the most important part of your installation . IT IS 1 mm The distance between string and GK-3 pick up. closer you play one note receive two notes farther sensitivity problem. Therefore , if you use this jack on Les Paul remember IT IS 1 mm how you do it is your creativity. Those people on You tube use a guitar which set by experience technician. Don' expect you do it that easy Detail is the clue, it is exciting. Piano is challenging. my last installation was with Axon controller .I put GK-2a on Les Paul. Axon 101 pick up on Fender full attention to radias and use the L device. after you are done installing put on 20X magnifier to see push the L between string and your pick up . It should go in and out touching the pickup and string without lifting the string. super important. The GK-3 is good. After installing 10-12 of them I am convinced the 1mm and 20 mm distance between saddle and GK pick up are essential.. Keep that in mind, Like I said not that many choices you have. unless you want to install some other Technic such as GHOST graph tech which you can buy it in Amazon. However before making any decision look at your ability to install. Do it professionally cost money. After all this. This GK-3 is the easiest way to get in. Remember your guitar must use steel string magnetic. Now my vote which is a BUY.  Good luck and Happy new year."

Personally I like the feel of a flurocarbon string so after switching my ukes to some of the more expensive strings I decided to switch a laminate uke or two over as well and the Martins are just fine for this purpose.\n\nI have a couple of nits.  One is that they weren't exactly generous with the length.  I could have used another couple of inches just to have a little more wiggle room while stringing up a concert.  And let's face it, the base material can't be expensive at all.  No need to be stingy with it.  And the other is that I don't feel like they're up to the standard of the more exotic/expensive/newer strings out there (Fremont, Worth, South Coast, whatever, basically any specialty string maker)."

Did some online research and discovered that there are serious issues with this new model. Many people are having to do multiple returns to finally get one that works. This is clearly a quality control / manufacturing problem with Fender and not any fault of Amazon's or other retailers. So, I ended up having to order a different model (one with a good dependability record)  and will wait a year or so to see if Fender gets it's act together before trying one of these again. Too bad because I really wanted one."

The design has a screw making connection to the braid and the housing, which is then supposed to connect to the sleeve connection on the input. However, if you wiggle it just right, this ground connection is lost and it will buzz.\n\nI fixed this by popping off (not easy) the two end caps on the right angle connector, soldering a wire from the braid directly to the sleeve connection, and then putting it back together (again, not easy). But now it works great, other than the hokey button design. Why'd they change something that worked so well??!"

They are nylon, but not in the fabric sense, in the \"these are pretty much oversized shower caps\" sense of a nylon product. That is the main distinction I would make. They are very thin and hardly protect drums from scratches or bumps. Two of them are already ripped from sliding them into my truck. They are a little bit of a hassle to get on the drums, too. It's almost better to leave them off and not trick your brain into thinking the drums are protected as you carry and pack them into the car.\n\nOn another note, Beato makes a higher tier of drum bags that are fairly decent. My friend has them, and although they are ripping in some areas, they have withstood years of abuse. I was naive in thinking I was getting a \"slightly\" cheaper version of his drum bags when I ordered these."

With a new Takamine in hand, I desired a warmer tone than I was getting with the stock strings so I purchased some wood bridge pins (to replace plastic ones) and these Elixir coated strings based on the handful of reviews claiming how much of a difference it made.\nThe Verdict. Warmth, maybe. But the sound seems discolored. Less bright and perhaps warmer on the high end, but not as \"bottomy\" or balanced/round on the lower end.\nBut sound aside, I ran into problems when installing these strings as my low E broke at the ball-end after just a few bends and insertion attempts. Never had a low E defect in 30 years of changings strings. High E perhaps, but never low E. Anyway with a few twists and turns, I made a makeshift knot at the end and got the set installed.\nSo for now, I'm still playing on them. Don't \"LOVE\" them as far as tone, but I'll give it a break-in period and revise my rating if somehow  my opinion of these \"top of the line\" strings improves enough to overlook the intital defect / poor quality I first experienced."

        "reviewText": "The previous reviews are pretty accurate, though I would add that when the Pignose cabinet is closed, it can often sound rather boxy. It sounded much clearer and cleaner when it was opened a couple of inches.\n\nAs for using pedals with it, it will take distortion to a degree. It reaches a point, if pushed too hard, at which the definition of the distortion will begin turning mushy and shrill. You can use a distortion + overdrive to decent effect, especially if you are running a cleaner sounding OD like a Tube Screamer. I don't think it would do so well with a Bad Monkey, for example, though, which has more dirt in the tones it produces. I don't have a fuzz box (not yet, but have one on order), but I think most fuzzes will sound like crap unless you use a relatively cleaner, sweeter one like the Red Witch Fuzz God or the Seymour Duncan Tweak Fuzz. Otherwise, you will hear too much ground asphalt in the sound.\n\nMy wah wah, a Morley Power Wah, was almost useless with it. The limited frequency response of the 5\" speaker made it sound overly throaty on cleans and when I put the boost in the shrillness would show itself again.\n\nA chorus pedal sounds totally sweet on it, but a phaser, in my case, a Phase 90, just destroys the sound. A flanger is also not really advisable. You can use delay, just not with very rapid repeats. Putting a compressor in front of your clean signal would probably make it more manageable for the Pignose' speaker. I just bought a Dynacomp, but haven't tried it on the piggy.\n\nThis is a good cheap first amp to buy for a youngster who is just beginning their journey on guitar and for practice when you are on the road on vacation or business. Once the young 'un seems dedicated, though, it is time to think about moving up to a VOX AC15C1 (note: that amp can do hard rock fine, but not high gain metal) or an ENGL Screamer. I personally can't imagine recording with it, but Y guess that would depend on the engineering skills available to you."

Spend the extra few dollars and go the Pro route. It's still cheaper than the competition and you are getting a very comparable cable. The Hosa Premium midi cables have very thick, solid midi connectors that fit nicely into you midi ports and the cable will not easily come out inadvertantly. The rubber-like shielding around the cable itself makes it feel well protected and it won't kink. I use them in the studio but they would work well on stage.

I've bought and sold literally dozens of pedals, many of them some kind of distortion, fuzz, OD, etc.  Its a hobby, addiction, whatever you wanna call it, I've owned way too many of these things.\n\nOne of my least favorite pedals was the Boss DS-1.  Sure, it was inexpensive and extremely durable, but it sounded lousy.  It was a noisy, brittle, fake sounding tone, and I didn't find a likeable sound no matter the settings or what guitar or amp I was running it through.  Long story short I had it modded into a particular Marshall overdrive circuit and its now fantastic as it sounds nothing like the stock models.\n\nSo imagine my surprise when I get a used DS-2 for a steal on ebay and its actually a good pedal!  This pedal does what the DS-1 was SUPPOSED to do but failed at:  Its a good, general purpose distortion.  Its not a super saturated sound, but its a likable tone that's far more full than the DS-1 ever got.  Also unlike the DS-1, it sounds great on every amp I've tried it on (one of which seems to hate boss pedals, so I was very impressed by that).\n\nIts not a metal distortion, but for classic rock crunch, this pedal does just fine.  I actually stacked it up against my script era MXR Distortion + and I was able to dial in a tone that sounded very similar, if just a touch less transparent.\n\nAll in all, a great, versatile little pedal that does exactly what its supposed to do.  If you're thinking of buying a DS-1, skip it, this thing is worth the little bit of extra cash, it is easily ten times the pedal.\n\nPOST SCRIPT EDIT (3-16-12):  I won ANOTHER DS-2 off ebay for a ridiculous steal again, this time one made in Japan.  GOOD NIGHT!  The Japanese ones are amazing!  Its like having a Marshall stack on the floor!  I mean these new ones are good pedals (esp compared to the new DS-1s) but the Japanese ones are flat out amazing.  I can only assume the Japanese DS-1s are similarly impressive, and if so, I can finally understand how that pedal ever got the reputation it for some reason still carries.  Grab a Japanese one if you can (and prepare to have your face melted!), if not, the new ones are still a fine pedal."

This is your deal.\"\n\nI strongly disagree.  You can find MUCH BETTER distortions for $100 or less, even a few near or under the $40 mark the DS-1 is currently priced at.\n\nI've played guitar for over 10 years.  Like many people one of my first pedal purchases was the DS-1.  Afterall, everyone talks about them, they're available at any given music store in the nation, you hear about all these famous musicians using them, plus a DS-1 is actually pretty cheap!  So I snapped one up just like everyone else.  Come to find out that just because something is POPULAR, that doesn't always mean its GOOD (see: Nickelback, the Transformers movie franchise, the Kardashian family, etc...).\n\nSo I plugged it in and didn't really care for it.  The distortion was harsh, thin, artificial sounding and always noisy.  I tried it on both my amps (My practic amp: a solid state Fender Frontman 25R, and my big amp, the B-52 AT100, which is a 100w tube halfstack) It was was not very diverse, and the basic sound was not very likeable to me.  I've read the Japanese made DS-1's are better in sound than the newer, made in Taiwan models but, either way, the DS-1 is just not a great pedal in my mind.\n\nBut, like many newer players, I didn't know any better at the time.  Fast forward a few years and I've bought and sold literally dozens of pedals.  There is a whole world of great tones to be found out there if you keep your eyes open.\n\nSo here are some pedals I currently own that I like much better than the DS-1.  All of them are great general purpose distortions, easy enough to find new and used in most guitar shops, and can, at the time of this writing, be bought brand new for $75 or less here on good ol' Amazon.com, and are rugged enough to last for years:\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Boss-DS-2-Turbo-Distortion/dp/B0002CZV8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Boss DS-2 Turbo Distortion</a>:  Lest I catch any flames from people thinking I'm a Boss hater (I'm certainly not, I loved the TU-3, the ODB-3, the MD-2, and the XT-2, among others) I'll start with the DS-1's big brother.  This pedal has a much nicer tone to it, not to mention 2 distinct distortion modes.  The I setting is pretty much a higher quality DS-1, the II setting is a brighter, richer tone.  As the DS-1 completely overshadows the DS-2 in popularity, you can find DS-2's all over ebay for very cheap prices.  A very worthy pedal, unfortunately overlooked by many.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Pro-Co-RAT2/dp/B0002MSQVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pro Co RAT2</a>:  Great dirty distortion pedal.  Probably my personal favorite.  You've heard this box used on literally hundreds if not thousands of songs in the last 30 years, its used by just a ridiculous amount of guitarists.  Its a rich, full distortion that at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy.  I've never heard a bad tone out of mine. Its great for getting a \"big amp\" kind of sound out of a small practice amp.  Its also great for pushing a big amp with too much headroom into the overdriven sweet spot without having to crank the amp volume.  A truly excellent pedal.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/EHX-Little-Big-Muff/dp/B000T517Y4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">EHX Little Big Muff</a>:  The Big Muff is another pedal you've heard on hundreds of songs.  Its kind of a fuzz, kind of a distortion, but definitely owns its own sonic territory.  Very big, saturated and warm.  Used heavily in the 70's for classic rock tones, also in the 90's and beyond for tons of grunge and garage.  Used by everyone from Carlos Santana and David Gilmour to the Smashing Pumpkins, Dinosaur Jr. and Jack White.  I personally reccomend the Little Big Muff, not only is it a touch creamier in tone than the recent NYC reissue, its smaller, uses a regular 9v adapter and its CHEAPER!  A great pedal.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/MXR-Distortion/dp/B0002E520C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">MXR Distortion +</a>:  The Distortion + is a great first distortion, and can usually be found pretty cheap.  Whats nice about the Distortion + is that it sounds great on anything, and the lack of a tone knob helps keep it somewhat transparent, i.e. you can more easily hear the natural tone of your guitar and amp, it doesn't cover over your equipments sound.  Used by quite a few famous folks, including the Greatful Deads Jerry Garcia, Randy Rhoads (Ozzy's famous guitarist) and Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Danelectro-CM-1-Cool-Cat-Metal/dp/B000A40NAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Danelectro CM-1 Cool Cat Metal</a>:  Make sure you get the Cool Cat Metal, NOT the Metal II.  That's a fine pedal as well, but its definitely more of a traditional metal pedal.  The Cool Cat Metal, or CM-1, is actually a very very different pedal from most metal pedals.  Basically, its a pre-amp that sits on the floor.  It has a fully adjustable EQ with tons of volume and gain through the roof.  So you can do anything from a clean boost (with the gain at minimum there is virtually NO coloration to your tone) to high gain metal stuff, with plenty of great overdrive and rock tones in between.  It works well with any amp I've tried it on, and you can find tons of great sounds.  Its an unbelievably versatile pedal, and its even true bypass.  The best part is, Danelectro seems to have made way too many of them, so you can easily find one used or even new for under $30.  A true hidden gem that's actually CHEAPER than a DS-1.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Joyo-JF-03-Crunch-Distortion/dp/B005LYIW3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Joyo JF-03 Crunch Distortion</a>:  This little guy surprised me.  Its supposedly a clone of the MI Audio Crunch Box, and, if so, that must be one awesome pedal too.  Its essentially a Marshall stack in a box, and boy does it ever succeed at that.  Great crunch, tons of volume and gain, it really can make your practice amp sound like a big ragin' stack!  It even sounded good going into my modeling amp (very few pedals work well with my modeling amp, and this one even sounded better than the Marshall simualtion built in), and you can get a brand new one for $40 shipped, fantastic!\n\nSpeaking of Joyo, I've had a few of their pedals as well as one or two from MOEN, another Chinese pedal maker, and I'm honestly floored by how nice they sound given their shockingly low price tag (especially the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/MOEN-MO-FM-Fuzz-Moo/dp/B007L5PVI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">MOEN MO-FM Fuzz Moo</a>&nbsp;which honestly out Big Muffs every Big Muff I've ever played through).  So JOYO and MOEN, they both make a variety of great sounding fuzz, od, and dirt pedals, check them out (and before anyone gets all up in arms about supporting a Chinese company, please keep in mind that NONE of the pedals listed in my review, DS-1 included, are made in America, let alone the western hemisphere).\n\nHopefully these suggestions give you something to look for.  Also, if you can't actually try a pedal out at the store, YouTube is great place to hear demos of what different pedals can do.\n\nI should also mention that if you try and love the DS-1 and it suits your needs, than more power to you.  Tone is subjective, every pedal sounds different running through different guitars and amps, and just because I may share different opinions on something that you love, that's okay.  My main reason for posting this lengthy review is to give newer players some information.  You have PLENTY of options for distortion pedals, the DS-1 is NOT the only thing out there that's affordable.  Find something you truly love and buy that.  If its the DS-1, one of the pedals I've mentioned here, or anything else, the important part is that it sounds right to YOU."

I've always used Odyssey cases (have the Odyssey CLP260PW) and thought this would be a great addition since I have an extra 60-70 LP records laying around that needed to be encased. Overall I'd rather prefer this over those colorful Krom or Eurolite plastic cases."

The clasps are now on the rack, not the lids. This is reverse of my 4 space gator rack and often leads to some fumbling around since I'm used to holding the clasps as I remove the lid. Same with putting the lids on - it makes much more sense to hold the lid by the clasps and put it on the rack\n\n2) The new handle sucks. Big time. It's not the nice bar of extruded aluminium, it's a cheesy nylon strap now with a thin strip of metal at each end where it slides in/out of the case. I keep a really heavy Fryette 2/90/2 tube guitar power amp in this rack and I'm not confident this handle is up to the task for the long haul."

I like how these feel when they work, and they do when new, but when they fail it can get ugly.\nIn my band I have to play acoustic guitar to compete in volume with banjo (which I cannot but I try anyway), so I tend to play hard. I typically use medium gauge strings.\nThe problem is that sometimes they chip when strummed hard, and the edge becomes jagged. I'm not talking about normal wear, i.e. strings abrading/scraping pick materials away slowly and gradualy. In the case of ultex, even though the normal wear is much slower than delrin and celluloid, suddenly some tiny chunk of material flies away and that's it. Once this happens the edge catches the strings and I cannot play solo any more, so I need to swap the pick in the next song to continue playing. I keep the pick anyway and sand the jagged edge later.\nTo give this thing some credit, I've never had a chipping problem when I play electrics with 10-42 set. I can imagine that this is a perfect pick for some players."

You don't need to install it in order to find it out: it is enough to measure the resistance between the wires. While it was correct on 2 pickups, it was infinite for the 3rd one, which means damaged wire.\n\nThe other set had all pickups alive, although I must say that the wire was unwrapping and falling off the body on one of the pickups. I installed them nevertheless and they worked.\nNow I want to comment on the performance. I was replacing ceramic pickups on an extra-cheap strat imitation guitar Giannini G-100 (from Costco) and naturally expected much better sound out of genuine Fender pickups. To my great surprise, the difference in sound was marginal. I of course tested all three pickup with clean and distorted modes. The worst part is that these pickups are much, much noisier than the original Giannini pickups. Even in \"humbucking\" 2nd and 4th switch position there was a lot of buzz, which is absent with the original pickups to which I returned.\n\nThe bottom line is, don't bother upgrading with Tex-Mex."

This is a somewhat common issue with electric guitars, but the amount of hum was much greater than with any other guitar I plugged to my amp before. (Note that this is not the kind of hum that humbucker pickups eliminate - the noise was even louder on the 2nd and 4th switch positions).\n3) The neck is slightly misaligned - high E string is too close to the edge of the fretboard while the low E is further.\n\nFor what it's worth, this guitar is worse in quality than also made in china extra-cheap Giannini G-100 from Costco (where it is sold for $100). Both are made in China and appear pretty identical, but Giannini seems to have a better quality control.  Sound-wize this guitar is marginally superior to Giannini."

I missed the opportunity to return it, but only because I wanted to like it and live with trying to tune it to make it work.\n\nIn that regard, tuning... I have to say, at higher pitches, it really shines, --it gets a nice woody tone, however brief (remember it is dry, not very resonant). It's almost like \"compression\" if you record... it hits it's peak and done, clips off there. However it is much more resonant, sustained at the higher pitches. At lower pitches, and forget floppy heads at all..., it's kinda ugly sounding. But, it is what it is!\n\nSo, maybe it is really a 5 Star head... but then, they should really provide Sound Sample Files mp3s and play'em with e.g., their EC2 Coated... (what I have and not, no mixing well).\n\nI have a feeling this may be a good head for a Bass Drum, batter side... then I could remove the silly pillow inside it?

Also, the plastic pins which came with my guitar appear to be rather cheap and thus, I thought there might be an opportunity for improvement perhaps on par with new strings or a pick more suitable to my tastes.\n\nThe good news is that I can say emphatically that bridge pins can change a guitar's sound.  The bad news is that they made my guitar sound absolutely horrible.  I experienced high pitched tinny sounds to the extent that I could only tolerate them for about 1/2 an hour before I felt compelled to remove them and replace the plastic pins.  The next day, I repeated the experiment with the same results just to ensure that something unexpected had not occurred during the installation process.  I will accept that depending on the guitar, these bridge pins may work for you.  In my case they absolutely did not.  However, for the price, it was a relatively inexpensive trial."

The \"vibe\" effect (it's actually a Univibe-type effect, not true vibrato) sounded very \"fake\" to me (not at all like the Cool Cat Vibe from the same company).

Combined with the (known) cheap construction, that made this pedal a big disappointment.\n\nBased on YouTube videos, I'm going to give the Cool Cat Vibe a try... it seems to have a much more realistic Univibe sound (and apparently uses the same optical technology as the original Univibe):&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Danelectro-CV1-Cool-Cat-Vibe-Pedal/dp/B0027DO66M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Danelectro CV1 Cool Cat Vibe Pedal</a>"

With the Original CryBaby, Dunlop has somehow managed (using testimonials from the pros) to sucker countless people, myself included, into thinking this is the Wah to get.\n\nProblems include the following:\n\nAlmost no low-end wah. Playing from a large, loud Marshall stack, if I play anything on the E6 or A5 strings and try to augment with wah you can't hardly hear any change. Granted I use very heavy distortion, but with high-end Seymour humbuckers and a Marshall stack, the sound is clean and distinguishable when not using the wah, and nearly the same when using it. For low-end I have noticed an interesting effect that IS possible though; activating the wah and then dropping it back to almost the back of the pedal and leaving it like that can make an interesting sound that would be comparable in comparison to talking normally and talking with your mouth nearly completely covered.\n\nThe other problem, which is actually present in MOST wahs (except one I'll mention in a second) is button activation. First of all, having to push the pedal UP to click it on makes it so you can't effectively start with a closed wah sound, only full open wah. Second, having to adjust the pedal just to get it to the point where it is activated uses precious milliseconds of deliberate action that could be spent focusing on that new lick you haven't perfected, or nailing every note in that solo you're performing.\n\nWhen I want wah I want it now. And when I want it I want to open into wah, not have it already open when the button is pressed. And when I'm done with wah I want it off. These problems have been solved by Morley with the Bad Horsie and Bad Horsie 2 Vai Wahs. They have no button so all you do is start pushing the pedal and it auto starts the wah-wah effect. When you are done with the wah, step off the pedal and it will deactivate in less than a second and go back to normal. Also, it's on a spring which may not be ideal for some, but it will reset the pedal to the down (back) position when your foot comes off. The good thing with this is you only have to push with your toes, essentially just stepping on it, and then lightening you step to bring it back instead of adjusting pressure to the heal and pushing it back down.\n\nAll that being said, it does work and it does create a wah-wah effect (though only effective through a clean amp or in lead sequences) so you do get what was advertised and at a decent price (the Bad Horsie is around 3 times as much).\n\nAdditional Info: Mine was purchased through Amazon from Dunlop and yet still did not come with a power adapter. Battery life is very, very short. And leaving a cable plugged into the \"Input\" (from the guitar) WILL run the battery down, even if the cable isn't plugged into anything on the other end. It makes no sense and can cost money."

I'm buying this.\" I have never been more disappointed in a pedal since I bought an Original CryBaby (compare it to a Morley Bad Horsie and you'll be disappointed in the CryBaby too).\n\nI understand that for some, depending on the style, this pedal works admirably. But to the metal heads out there...DON'T BUY THIS!!! IT WILL NOT SATISFY YOUR THIRST FOR TOTAL CONTROL OVER THE SOUND (and sound level specifically)\n\nNot only does it not adjust sound very well at all at high gain levels, the swelling/quelling of volume is completely flawed. It's as if the volume scale went from one to two to three to EIGHT with nothing in between leaving you with basically two possible volume levels: whisper quiet (it WILL NOT reduce the sound to zero. I guarantee), or full volume.\n\nDo not buy this pedal. There are plenty of far better volume pedals, or you can do it the old fashioned way and change the volume on the guitar itself."

The inside height of the case metal edge to metal edge is 7 3/4\", slightly more plastic to plastic.\nI agree with others about how flimsy the foam at the bottom of the case is.  It feels like something you would use for an air filter -- not for protecting a microphone from shock.\nWhen mine arrived, the strap that limits the lid motion had a half twist in it.  It was impossible to train it to fall into the case as the lid was closed.  Fortunately it is secured with hot-melt glue, so it was easy to pull it loose, roll the glue off the inside of the case, take out the half twist and re-glue the strap to the case.\nIn my opinion, the latches are nicely designed.  The latch-plate is circular and surrounded by a circular ridge of the case except for the opening where your finger can slide in to open the latch.  That gives reasonable protection from accidental opening, and you can tell by feel if the case is top-side-up by whether the opening is at the bottom.  The latch has an over-center spring in the pivot side that provides a force tending to keep the latch closed.\nIn summary, the case has some flaws and some nice features.  It is a whole lot nicer than the cardboard box I was using before."

There are many differences between the two instruments.\n\nFirst of all the Adler recorder has a richer softer more mellow tone compared to the louder more piercing tone of this instrument.  The two instruments are also made in separate countries.  The Adler is made in Germany, whereas the Yamaha is made in China.  The two instruments are also encased differently.  The Adler comes in a blue and white Velcro case.  The Yamaha comes in a cheap plastic case with a hard to close snap.\n\nBoth of these instruments have Baroque fingering.  For the most part, they both play each note in tune, except for one. The F note on the Yamaha recorder is actually F sharp.  Not so on the Adler.  If you have a recorder student in your household who is learning to play the instrument for the first time, this recorder is fine for that.  As he or she grows up and advances in music, consider buying an Adler soprano recorder.  Recorder teachers should also be aware of the differences between these two instruments."

It felt like it was made from a cut of really cheap pine or other cheap wood. The neck joint is very flimsy and the guitar easily gets out of tune because of this flimsy cheap joint. The pickup selector switch would cause bursts of static when switching while playing - cheap pickups and very little tone control - even though this is meant to resemble a Fender Strat - that's the extent of any comparison. This package would be okay for a beginner - better than the cheapo package guitars you see in the big box discount stores, but not a very good guitar. In the same price range - or for a few bucks more Epiphone and Ibanez might be a better choice."

Secondly for the price you pay this cable seems amazing, granted I've only gotten to practice with it for about three hours, but it seems to pass a signal really well.  It appears to be well constructed: solid tweed cover (Which I much prefer to the old rubber coating), longer rubber reinforcement jacket near the plugs than the other low-end guitar cables I've had, and a Velcro tie to keep the cable together when wound up is a nice touch.  Overall I would definitely recommend this product to anyone and will be sure to update this review if I end up having any technical problems with the cable."

I play mostly classic rock and blues covers which is where this bass excels.  It has amazing tone and growl to die for.  I bought mine used and it was set up and ready to go by the time it got to me (just needed a new set of strings).  With a set of DiAddario semi flats and a KB200 amp I got a tone I'm not going to try to replace for a long time.  It wasn't a purchase I rushed into I tried other Epiphones (EB series [what can say I say, I'm attracted to the Humbucker]), Squire's, Ibanez (gsr, sr), ESP, and even a Danelectro.  None, NONE of those came close to the tone I got from the Thunderbird (of course I may be bias as it does play into the genre I prefer).  Any Bass that had a better sound was easily twice the price ($600+).  The body is killer, and as far as I can tell indestructible (You can search reviews online and find testimony to this).  Watch out for the neck dive though, I didn't think it would bother me at first, but after holding through practice for a couple hours it gets tiring. The neck is pretty chunky, it's not what I would call \"fast\". 4 stars is appropriate for this bass, It's good but needs a few modifications to be great."

This bass was a serious disappointment.  I've got a lot of love for Gibson and (due to $$$) Epiphone.  When I saw the Epiphone EB series in my local guitar shop I fell in love.  How can you not appreciate that SG body, and I've always preferred humbuckers to P or J pickups.  I thought I had found my hearts desire when I picked this up and began to play (classic rock & blues covers for reference) and then my heart broke.  The sound was lousy.  Of course I tried a different EB bass and different amps but the situation never improved.  Despite my sincerest wishes I can't recommend this excellent looking bass to anyone (unless they're looking for wall art or are willing to switch out the pickups).  You can pay the same price and get much better tone (I would recommend a Squire Jaguar if you really want a humbucker or if you want more tone versatility a Yamaha RBX 170)."

While the guitar has a nice thin neck and light (agathis) body it has thin sound.  While that might work for rhythm or lead it doesn't cut it for the LOW-End.  The electronics are nice but the tone just isn't there.  For $200+ you should be able to find a superior bass with a deep low end.  If you're really looking for a beginning bass I would recommend a Yamaha RBX 170, same price but better tone (despite having Passive electronics)."

I don't what guitar that those folks are talking about but it assuredly not the S34C .\n\nLet me start by saying that the guitar looked great right out of the box . Overall the guitar has a nice satin finish . The binding is well done and both the bridge and fretboard seem to be decent quality rosewood . The tuners a sealed , turn smoothly and don't have any wobble .The nut and saddle look like some kind of synthetic bone and both look to be slotted and seated correctly . The neck is slim and feels very comfortable in your hand . The body size is a little smaller and slimmer then a standard dreadnought and sits/hangs nicely while playing either standing or sitting .\n\nNow to the problems . The string action was crazy high right out of the box . Combine that with severe fret buzz at the first three frets makes the guitar unplayable . A closer inspection reveals that the second fret is ridiculously high and needs to be leveled and crowned . I simply can't believe that this guitar was allowed to leave the factory in the condition . I know it's only a $100 guitar but if isn't playable then the discount price doesn't matter . It would taken just a few minutes to run the thing back over to the fretting department and have them fix the bad fret instead of just sending it . Now I'm returning it and Amazon will send it back them . I hope that they fix it before selling it to someone else .\n\nTo summarize I would rather have an ugly guitar that plays well as apposed to a nice looking guitar that plays terribly . To give the benefit of the doubt it is possible that I just got a bad one . However the one I got was so bad that I opted for a refund and not replacement . I would recommend exercising caution when buying a S34C ."

I thought the nylon strings would be better for tiny tender fingers, but they are so dull and muted. The thing sounds like a ukulele with a sinus infection. If you have a young one sincerely wanting to pursue music - look on ebay or craigslist for a real guitar, even if used. A little more money would have gone a long way towards a better music learning experience.  I will say as a positive though, the sizing was nice for my daughters small frame.

The way the design has been stitched on exposes the underside. I would not use this playing gigs or anything, as I doubt it would hold up too well. However I use it for the home studio under less stressful conditions and I think it will last longer."

The positives have been covered so I'll point out a few (minor) things I don't like.\n\nFirst of all the power button is on the back, which is annoying. The rest of the controls are on top, why do I have to grope around the back to find the most important button. Plus I keep it in a cabinet so I have to pull it out to turn it on yand off.\n\nNext! I wish they'd just name the settings \"clean\", \"overdrive\", \"distortion\", and so on. JC Clean, Black Panel, Brit combo and R-Fier mean nothing to me.\n\nThen there's another minor annoyance that the input is recessed. A 90 degree angle plug won't fit unless you run it around the back.\n\nLastly, the amp is solid and rugged but that means it's heavy. Not heavy like I can't pick it up, just heavy for something called a micro amp.\n\nNone of these are deal breakers, just things I find annoying. Overall I have to say I prefer my VOX mini 3.\n\nUpdate: Roland basically fixed my important concerns with the new version of the Micro Cube, the GX. it's over a pound lighter, the power switch is on top where it belongs, plus it's got more features like the Cube Jam software ( which I don't really use but it looks cool). I'm not thrilled with the built in effects but they're still fun to mess with and you can always use pedals instead.\n\nSo basically, the Micro Cube GX is a strong buy, the older version you'll want to avoid (my opinion).\n\nBuy the one that says \"CUBE\" across the grill and you'll have a great little practice amp.."

My friend tried it on her acoustic guitar and hated it.\n\nHer reason for her opinion is simple. This stuff puts out a LOT more oil (or whatever it is) than you would think. This has the unintended consequence of the oil making your hard-earned callouses soft...which when playing guitar can lead to bleeding fingers pretty fast (and did for my friend).\n\nTo apply this you simply hold the handle and press down while running it along each string, one string at a time. I highly suggest you only use one slide down each string. At first it may not look like anything is getting on your strings, but give it a few minutes and you will start to see the excess oil appear and start pooling under the strings on your fretboard. That's ok. You will need to wipe away the excess, and I'm telling you, if you accidentally get too much, that excess oil may not come off easily (didn't for me at least). Mine left little pools of oil between the frets, and I only used one swipe and thought I had just a little on there. Naturally, this product also makes your fingers very oily feeling. My friend hated that part too, and I agree with her. Soft callouses = no callouses. This is a good product idea, and I like it in theory, and with my thick bass strings I didn't have the severe problem w soft fingertips that she did. Just be aware of the possibility of that being a problem for you.\n\nIt does what it says, but you may not like what else it does or how it feels on your fingers."

I've used many different types of picks over the years and I've not found the ideal one for me until recently when I decided to use a SilverPick which is basically a standard triangle thin design but made of silver which I find fits my needs the best and so far it's just a case of getting used to it.  This particular Dunlop pick is as described being fat, stubby and sturdy with a nice grippable centre and if you are the kind of lead guitarist who uses a lot of pinch harmonics this pick will be good for you as the maximum grip and most comfortable holding position exposes very little of the pick face.  The hardness will make it good for fast playing but the thickness also makes it difficult to get a firm grip too and the very small size makes it easy to lose your grip if you hit the strings too hard.  This makes it unfit for bass players and for strumming although you could get used to this for lead guitar playing.  For me though, I'll keep this among my collection of picks for use but it's not my default or preferred choice for play."

I was messing around in a used guitar store playing my Fender bass through my Hartke LH1000 and the store's used Hartke Hydrive 810 that I've been checking out; making a lot of noise, when one of the store attendants told me to turn it down so they could hear the phone calls that were coming in. So, I took a break, looking around, and asked about drum machines. They showed me the Alesis SR16, explained how it worked, gave me a 10% discount and I left the store for home.\n\nThis thing is so easy to work with. I created a song within hours using the AABA method with no problem. The only reason I haven't gave this thing a 5 star rating is because I just bought it and I may be suffering from over-excitement, but for $80.00 I feel like a got a deal AND, this machine is Just What I Needed.\n\nWill keep you posted on further results...\n\n7/14/12\n\nI'm still diggin this machine. I've programmed my own drum beats into it without too much trouble. The fun part is learning how to program the machine, which is promising as opposed to tedious or frustrating.\n\n7/18/12\nLast post for this item.\n\nThis machine is amazing! I'm not a drummer, I'm a bass player, but I've recorded 3 drum tracks that I am pleased with and I'm having fun learning what and what not to do. For example, mixing a bunch of patterns together even if they are in the same grouping is not something you'd want to do. Having a structured thought to follow and using Fills at the right time are things that make the drumming believable. Creating your patterns at a slow tempo and then playing them back in real time is the way to go."

However, this product review is based on my expectations as a customer and my specific needs.\n\nFirst, this amp does NOT come with an AC power adapter. This is not stated in the product specifications. It never says specifically otherwise, but any other peice of electronic I've purchased, it goes without saying, comes with the POWER necessary to use the item. It does come with a 9v battery, that, according to other reviews only lasts 15 minutes. This is a scam to me as a 9v battery costs much less than an AC adapter. Additionally you can use an AC adapter forever with this amp but only 15 mintues with one battery. If I had know that I had to purchase an AC adpater separately, I would have puchased a different amp.\n\nSecond, when I tested the sound with the supplied battery, I felt that my cheesy computer speakers have a better sound quality. And the overdrive, for distortion, as one other reviewer stated, is accomplished by causing the speaker to go to a level it can't handle. This simply sounds like the speaker isn't designed to perform at this level, much like playing a high bass sound through my cheesy computer speakers.\n\nConclusion, I would never use this mini amp, even for practice because the sound is too lousy. My feelings, save the $20 (for amp) + $6 (guitar cord) + $6 (9v AC adapter) = $32. Then apply that $32 toward a good $100 amp. So, I'm returning the amp and doing just that.\n\nThanks for reading..."

If you turn everything up to \"11,\" it sounds pretty bad--harsh and abrasive.  By backing off the output (\"volume\" knob) from the guitar, you can get some good rock tones, at a variety of distortion levels.  Want it a little grungier?  Turn up the distortion.  A little edgier?  Turn up the tone control, to increase the treble.  Use the volume knob to control your levels into your amp or mixer.  Simple.  Just don't max out the guitar output going into the unit, and you'll have tons of tonal colors to play with.  I'm running the pedal as a DI box, straight into the mixer, with some outboard compression from a rack mounted unit.  Makes some very sweet sounds.  Very easy for recording.  But one caveat: This is pretty much for lead guitar, only.  It's too grungy for chord work."

But I can say that it was promptly returned the very next day due to its inability to function properly. The pedal is held by a flimsy little squeeze piece of metal in which couldn't stay on to save its life. Every two pumps of the hi hat pedal that metal piece would fall off and the pedal would start hopping all over the floor. It was a cheap piece of junk. Unless you are a child and going to break this piece of equipment do not get it. Its not worth the $53 that they're selling it for. Spend the extra 20 and go for the next series up."

It does not seem to suck tone at least, even when both channels are on ('Y' mode) but if you use this for 'A' OR 'B' the off channel will get signal bleed. So in my case, when my clean pod is ON (A is selected), the distorted amp which should be OFF (B) but still bleeds through, ruining the clean tone. Also, no 9v adapter - had to use a battery eliminator cable(not included). Fed up with these lousy A/B products - ordered a loop master."

Electric guitars don't resonate, that's why pickups are important.\n  I don't like the idea of this as beginners choice for the simple fact of cheap tuning keys.\n You lose interest learning on something that can't hold good tuning.  So that bugs me that big player choice like epi would do that.\n  It's likely they'll keep this style but revise it some... to be hardwood body and real tuners as I  think the price point demands it.

I guess in ibanez price range it's a good starter, it feels ibanez, but it's missing the good hardware.\n  Humbuckers are just generally better stronger pups, that makes this guitar.  But the pickups here had plastic base plates? You never see on good buckers, sound ok though don't see them lasting. cheap tuners needed upgrade on both, 1 was 10 mm holes (easy replace) other was small holes with inserts (schaller type) had to drill out to 10mm.\n  Fat 6 tremelo not awful but not great, cheap zinc block and non-standard 6 screw mount pattern hard to upgrade to better without good bit of effort.  Plastic nut not great either but easy upgrade to bone nut.\n  In short nice guitar with less than great hardware. Upgraded to locking tuners and roller saddles, this helped bridge and general tuning stability, bone nut, new bucker. So I put $ in to get what is basically an ibanez rg which needs not much of anything at all.\n  But in the end I maybe saved a few $ and now they both play excellent.

For years I used seemingly indestructable guitar cables that were made for me by an electrician friend.  When they finally gave out, I got in the habit of using the no-name cables that are always on display near the register at Guitar Center- really more of an impulse buy than something I put any thought into.  After the third or fourth Guitar Center cable failed from light use I decided to try these cables.  Not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better.  I am not terribly hard on my gear but my cables tend to get twisted as I move around and the cheaper ones  eventually fail mid-cable.  I don't mind spending a few extra dollars if the cable is a little more durable.  This cable is actually cheaper- $12 or so shipped- and it's holding up pretty well.  These are actually very reasonably priced for 18' cables.  There is some kind of limited life warantee on this product but I haven't needed it.  Five stars for a nicely made 18 foot guitar cable that costs $12 shipped!\n\nIncidentally- these cables are shielded and are meant to connect your instrument to your amp's input.  Do not use these to connect an amplifier to a speaker cab.  You want to use unshielded cables for that purpose.\n\nEdit-  More than 6 months has passed and this cable is functioning without any issues.  The price on these things has gone up significantly and although the cable is highly recommended, there are probably better values from Hosa, Monster or Planet Waves-"

This pedal does a decent job covering your tremolo needs, but IMHO the tremolo from Dano's Cool Cat line is a much more durable pedal for only $4 more (at the time of this review).  The switches and knobs on this pedal are the weak link.  I don't think it's true bypass either.  The Cool Cat has a metal enclosure, true bypass, sturdier inputs and knobs, and a much better on/off switch.  The features and sound are the same.

That really depends on what sound you are trying to get and what other gear/technique you are using with it.  If you are using bad gear or poor technique it will not perform miracles.  It will not make your 15 watt solid state Ibanez Soundblaster amp sound like a raging Orange Rockerverb and it will not make single coils sound like EMG 81/85s.  But arguing over what pedal is 'best' is like two painters arguing over what color is best used to paint a sunrise.  This pedal is good for a tight kind of distortion- but not so heavy that you can do modern metal if running into a clean amp - if that makes any sense. It it doesn't make sense, there are ample Youtube reviews you can check out before pulling the trigger.  It has been used by professional players like Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, and Kurt Cobain. It is a professional pedal used by professional musicians.  It's built like a brick and durable as all get-out.  I found mine used for $20, but the new asking price is fair. I would like to see Boss start using true bypass instead of the buffered bypass they use, but admittedly I don't detect any tonesuck with it.  I've run mine into a tube amp on the verge of breakup and it can really get things cooking.  It also takes an overdrive or sustainer pretty well to bump the gain and get some singing leads.  With the exception of 'modeler' type pedals from companies like Tech 21, I do not think that any dirtboxes- this included- perform optimally when run into a solid state amp.  So if you are not happy with the way it is distorting your Marshall MG, the problem is in your amp."

These emit a HUGE amount of RF interference, and there's no way they're FCC/CE tested or approved. Shame on Visual Sound for selling these without bothering to make sure they don't pollute your signal chain.\n\nThese supplies (we tested several) were all way over the limit by a huge amount (+35dB, which is more than 3000x the allowed amount). This causes other equipment to pick-up this interference, and any even slightly imperfect metal-to-metal contact will demodulate the noise down into the audio range. That's why people are complaining about these being noisy. They are. Wrapping the entire length of the cable around a huge RF torroidal filter doesn't get rid of the noise, that's how loud they are!\n\nThe best thing about these is they put out 1700mA of power, but there are others that beats this with 2000mA of current and don't spew the RF noise."

I reasoned that if it played really nice, I could live with the fact that it's an ugly chunk of plastic.  Well...  Yes, it does come apart super fast and easy without any tools, but aside from that, there is nothing about this thing that impresses (or even satisfies) me.  1. Maybe some are airtight, by mine sure wasn't.  The design prevents any external air leaks, but it still leaks internally (a leak is a leak). 2. The mouthpiece is really thick - like having a big bar of soap in your mouth. Tone is subjective so some might like it, but I hate it - really dull sounding. When you blow through the comb and reed-plates alone, it sounds better, so I think it's that big plastic body that takes all the life out of the tone. 3. Did I mention that it's one big, thick piece of plastic?  UPDATE: Just got a new Seydel Saxony.  Well, compared to the Saxony, the CX12 seems like one of the \"prizes\" that you'd win for knocking over a bottle at a carnival. The Saxony is nearly twice as much, but it looks, feels, and plays like it cost 20 times as much!  UPDATE 3/16/14:  It's now a year later, and I still LOVE my Seydel Saxony.  Instead of continuously upgrading, just buy the Saxony and be done with it."

If you are trying compare string size on Amazon, and the seller happens to provide them, then all is well.

The new box has ample room to provide this information in its multi-flap format, but no, not a single vital dimension to be found; just marketing, marketing and more art-director heavy design.  Having worked in advertising most of my life, I well know what happens when the creative types are given freedom to \"create.\" Information becomes secondary to design, and the customer suffers.  Why is this important?  Well, if you have spent the time to have a luthier set up your guitar, or have learned his skills yourself, you know that your guitar neck is a delicate compromise between action and buzzing.  If all you do is pound out rhythm on the first 3 frets you will not care; however, if you are experienced and use plenty of bar and chord inversions all over the neck, you want to be certain the different string tensions will not require a truss-rod adjustment.  Believe me, most truss rods have a limited number of times you can adjust them before the bolts strip, threads seize, or it reaches some other limit to motion.  Please, Gore & Associates, put this vital information back on your packages, and don't force us to go to your website like have to do to find out actual string tension.  The string thickness at least allows one to compare to another set. You already have the graphic files on computer and only need an hour or so to place them somewhere on the new packages. Art-director-itis, the disease that infects marketing departments that are in a desperate effort to increase sales - let's redesign the package.

But it is anything but something to use for more than that.\n\nNotes:\n1) Emits a foul sharp odor that smells like burning plastic. Sometimes, makes me want to choke and cough.\n2) You have to direct your voice into the area above the label else it sounds \"lost\"\n3) Has a tinge of a deep, lower bass sound from it.\n4) For vocals, if you have to hit a loud note, it breaks up miserably. You have to back off the mic a good 12 inches to avoid this. And it sounds really horrible.\n\nOverall a decent microphone for the price. Well built, sturdy construction. Nice extra with the shock mount. But you get what you pay for.\n\nUpdate 1/2/13:\nBacking this down to 2 stars.\nThe shock mount screws as they sit into the shock mount ring will no longer fit as they worse out. I can no longer use the mount with a mic stand because the outer ring wore out."

Un-muddied left hand bass and crisp high notes. I'm hearing subtleties in my keyboard that I haven't heard before. I'm using them on stands behind me in my Irish band to mic an accordion and tin whistle and they both sound great with these speakers running through an 8 channel Yamaha mixer.\n\nAt 32lbs, they're easy to carry around, especially with the totes, and light to get up on stands. These speakers go really loud, so it's nice that I can set the speaker fader only half way and still get good volume. Really helps prevent feedback from the condenser  mics."

Any string that has to be \"modded\" to fit through any part of a Fender bridge is a very poorly designed string. Why are we making excuses? I love D'Addario strings for electric guitar. I use them all the time in my shop. Check out the pic of how the string sits on this USA Fender. Inexcusable. Makes it impossible to set up the instrument. That D string in my pic, btw, is a GHS.

Compared to the competition, even the \"old\" design was only marginally effective; the sponge inside that holds the moisture was barely big enough to do the job.  Now, rather than slightly raise the price (which I'd rather pay for a unit that's gonna work), they SHRINK the size of the absorbent media.  In the case of candy bars, all you get is less for your money.  In the case of a guitar humidifier, you get a product that WILL NOT protect your investment (aka: your guitar).\n\nI recommend NOT wasting time on this unit.

I thought oh I must have the tone control rolled back, nope. I checked my guitar cord, the amp. I had a thought they changed something so looked at the package and sure enough, it now says MADE IN CHINA. So, I dug up one of my regular Fender white Heavy picks and played it and the bright biting tone I loved so much from these picks was immediately there. Shame on Fender for trying to maximize profits and cut out the American pick makers to squeeze more money out of us musicians. These picks absolutely are the worst picks I've ever tried, they absolutely kill treble response and any kind of liveliness. I thought, ok, maybe I got a bad batch, so went to Musician's Friend and ordered another batch, they were identical and sounded horrible too. This is the END of Fender picks for me, never buying any again...."

Also, the winding is excessive, and I am concerned the E string is going to pop off due to winding and winding the thick string (no wire cutter handy and the pliers I always use to cut strings does not work on these strings). The G string's tension is so tight on the otherwise low tension set, that I consider this set not even playable. Will try to return to Amazon, may be a defective set as far as tension.  Do not suggest buying for your 34\" scale bass."

A couple of things to know when you do add these:\n\n1.) Not all guitars use the same screw in this position. Do yourself a huge favor and get a drill bit slightly smaller than the threads on the screw and re-drill the hole on your guitar.\n\n2.) This hint is true for all wood screws (going into wood): Get a candle and run the threads of the screw down the side of the candle. This puts a little wax on the threads and will make it MUCH EASIER to screw the screw in.\n\n3.) I usually wind up opening the hole up in the guitar strap a small amount so that these fit correctly. There is no way the manufacturer can know what kind of strap you use, so work with it, don't complain about it!\n\n4.) You may have to shave the thickness of the strap a bit as well."

They are a little harder to play than the D' Addario strings that I am used to on my other guitar, and the Martins that I have used in the past.

My daughter unplugged the amp, and the metal piece on the guitar fell off.  My husband tightened it, but it got loose again.  We are hoping this is not going to become an issue.

I've used these clips a grand total of three times. I've already had two clips fall off because they weren't tight enough and one broken because I tightened it too far.\n\nI've gone back to the cheap plastic clips (which haven't fallen off or broken once in over a year of use) and hold these in my kit as emergency replacements.\n\nI suppose they would work in a studio setting, where you have lots of time to set up and adjust your drum  mics, but for my purposes - fast and cheap recording of live punk bands - these clips were a waste of money."

I can overcome this problem if I position adjacent winder keys perpendicular to the line between adjacent machines.

The peg puller cutout is too small to fit over the pegs in my Washburn acoustic, so that feature is useless to me.

I play primarily through an American Deluxe Strat-HSS. My LP is too hot and sounds kind of like hot trash through it.\n\nFirst, what I would not do with this amp - \"gig\" with it. Play it out, play it live or with a drummer. It is a $70 - 10w solid state amp. You have to crank it to do those things and solid state amps just don't sound as good maxed as they do at mid levels. This amp sounds terrible with everything dimed. That doesn't mean you can't...and if your budget is only $70 for your amp, then do what you gotta do.\n\nWhat is has. Gain control & channel, volume, bass and treble. Using the gain channel as a distortion doesn't sound great to me. In fact it sounds like a can of bees. Not the good Cobain kind of bees; the, \"I think your amp is smokng, dude,\" kind of bees.\n\nHowever, using the gain control (not channel) and volume together creates a very full clean sound. Some of my pedals like clean boosts or clean drives don't really do much with the Pathfinder, but they are designed for tube amps and that is understandable (refer to above \"bee\" sounds for a better description). Also, analog delay doesn't sound great, but digital delays and light reverb are cool (of course).\n\nI use it for true bedroom practice. and just wanted something that I could run my pedal board into that had a little character. We also have had a Roland Microcube in the house, but it is very sterile sounding. The Vox actually carries that Vox tone and has a bit of warmth. I've also spent a lot of time on the AC4TV tube amp and that is much better, but also a lot louder and $300.\n\nI do knock of stars for the non existant gain and amps intolerance for effects. For the price, less than a cheap effect pedal or video game with some DLC, this is an awesome value and really good clean practice amp. Again, if you need to practice your Meshuggah riffs, you need to look elsewhere. A tiny bit of reverb and delay sounds really good and for open chording or practicing with your headphones on, this is a great investment."

My amp gives me a nice warm crunch, classic rock style. The DS-1 gives me the 80's metal and punk rock sound I wanted, and it does so flawlessly.\n\nIt took me about 5 minutes of tinkering to get a nice transition from my amp to a matching tone on the DS-1. It's BOSS, so it will last forever.\n\nTh only drawback is that it's an item that is currently cheaper elsewhere.

In actual comparison with several cartridges at this price level AND higher, this cartridge invariably shows up unnaturally bright and fatiguing.\nIts generous tracking ability and freedom from sibilance is a virtue shared with several competitors also.\nBUT one competitor shares the great tracking ability together with the nice look of quality manufacturing, more natural (and non-fatiguing) treble, AND substantially lower price. The Denon DL-110 delivers more natural tone and staging, including generous tracking and freedom from the irritating treble tone of this Audio Technica cartridge. The DL-110 is a better performer for a lower price."

And I could not use the original Epiphone screw because the head of the screw would not fit into the Schaller lock.  I then installed these Dunlop strap locks on the same guitar with good results.  I also installed these Dunlops on an Epiphone Les Paul ES Pro and an Epiphone Viola Bass guitar.  For the Epiphone Les Paul ES Pro and the ES339, I did not need to do any drilling and the new screws got a good bite into the wood.  But, on my Epiphone Viola Bass...when I was installing the provided screw near the neck...the screw hit something solid which might have been the truss rod.  I had to cut-off about 1/3 of an inch on the screw to make it fit.  Again, I could not use the original Epiphone screw because it just doesn't fit the Dunlop lock.  As others have mentioned, the Dunlop locks \"stick out\" about 1 1/8 inch from the guitar when the strap is attached.  It looks a little weird, but I'm sure I'll used to it.  I plan to get a couple more of these same locks to put on my other guitars."

Yes, it is loud -- louder than the Firth and other pads that are wood or composite bases with a rubber pad on them -- those have little or no sound, unless they have BBs or other objects designed to mimic a snare sound like the Pro-mark X-pad. On the other hand, this pad is about the same or a little quieter than the Firth stock pad and slimpad -- ones designed to mimic the feel of a marching snare.\n\nI own several pads, including this one. This Remo pad is the one I don't use. This would be a better pad if it were still built as it was in the '70s -- more or less the top of a snare drum with padding under the head. The older ones had metal rather than plastic rims and was tunable with drum keys rather than a screwdriver. If you can find a cheap one used, get it. Its size and light weight are a big plus. Throw it in a backpack with some sticks and you can practice on the road. But make sure you are all by yourself or in another part of the house."

It appears others have also received a different item then what is pictured above by Amazon. Considering the issues they mention, I am not at all surprised by the issues they are having. This stand is not designed as well as the XCG-4s I know. End caps simply fall off. Neck yoke band strap is different size and not as firm. Body yoke is narrower. There is more play where the Vee groove sits in the bottom tube. Creating more distance for the Tee handle screw to travel in to hold the top tube firmly. T handle knob is smaller.\nAdded up its not as easy to use.\n\nBest I could find out from On-Stage was that they did change/modify the XCG-4 Classic Stand.\n\nWhat those changes were, I cant say.\n\nThe silver label with silver underline reading; On-Stage only, is the one I am reviewing.\n\nKnowing the previous iteration of this stand, I would not recommend this stand."

Amazon got me taken care of almost immediately, so I'm really happy about that.\n\nIn any event, the guitar is a GREAT value for the money. It has great tone and sustain, the neck is fast and wide making it easier to play, especially if you have big hands. I had a Squier Strat Standard at one time and it does not even come close to this guitar (or the Epiphone SG-310 I had prior to the LP-100) in quality OR sound. There's just NO comparison.\n\nSpeaking of the SG-310, I actually think it sounds a bit better than the LP-100, however, both are very versatile and can play just about any music. Quality and construction are excellent. This is NOT a \"beginner\" guitar. You can perform live with it and I think it will hold up fine for YEARS!\n\nI miss my SG and will most likely pickup another one very soon, but I don't regret getting another LP (I had one for over 20 years). This truly is an excellent guitar for such a little price.\n\nI've been playing since about '72 and it's easily (along with the SG) one of the best guitars I've owned. You really do get Gibson sound without the Gibson price tag. There are higher-level LP's (and SG's) with the neck thru bodies (the LP-100 and SG-310 have bolt on necks) and I may \"move up\" someday, but I have no complaints at all with this guitar. Didn't have any with the SG either. Oh, yeah, higher-end models use different/better wood. Just don't think this guitar is the \"cheap stuff\"...you would be very wrong if you did.\n\nI give it 4 stars because I think the SG-310 beats it in the sound/sustain department...but JUST barely. There's a reason the LP has been a music staple for DECADES and this model carries on that tradition.\n\nAll in all, the LP-100 was a VERY wise choice for me."

So, that convinced me to try out the GM108 amp.\n\nI received it yesterday and I have to admit...I really like it. Has very good sound although you have to set it just right. The distortion is not the best, and it can overwhelm you. The amp modeling is not bad, although there seems to be very little difference between the U.K. and U.S. settings. I've read where people complain the clean setting is too quiet. Hmmm...mine seems to be fine. It's not super loud, but not soft, either.\n\nIt seems to handle my HellBabe and Digitech RP55 mutli-effects pedal pretty well, also.\n\nI haven't tried connecting my iPod to it, yet, but I think that is a cool feature. Also, not sure if I will use the amp modeling very much, since the RP55 has that covered. I plug headphones directly into the RP55 when I need to be quiet, so I don't need that in the amp.\n\nSo, why'd I get it, then? Easy, it beats lugging my 32 year old Hohner 1230 around. The fact that it has a few features and sounds great is just gravy for me.\n\nI definitely recommend this amp.  Oh, yeah..sounds MUCH louder than 15 watts! It's a whole lot of amp for $60! I had my my eye on a Fender Frontman 10G. I think this is a much better deal!\n\nMay 6th 2010 update:\n\nWell, bad news. My amp developed a horrible thud noise and static when playing. Thought it was my less than 2 month old Epiphone SG-310 which I've since returned. Got an Epiphone LP-100, plugged it in and it's doing the exact same thing. Tried a new cord as well.\n\nI'm swapping out the amp for a new one. Should be here in a couple of days. Let's hope it last's more then 30 days this\ntime!\n\n2nd update May 10th:\n\nWell, goodbye amp. Makes the exact same thud, muddy, staticy sound through the headphones and without them! Tried several new cords, too. I just set it up to be returned for full refund.\n\nTrust me, try one of there other (bigger) amps or another brand."

        "reviewText": "Monster makes some decent quality cables and while no less reliable than other major manufacturers' cables they are more expensive than other brands.  Monster throws lots of techno-babble around about things like \"time correct windings\" but if the cable doesn't work it doesn't matter how good it is.  Their higher end products make more of a difference in sound quality than their entry level line.\n\nMonster makes three series of progressively more expensive microphone cables which are the 100 (this one), the 500 (BETTER) and 1000 (BEST.)  This \"100\" cable series is their \"entry level\" mic cable and their lightest weight XLR cable series with the smallest diameter cable.\n\nWhile the cable itself is small in diameter, the 100 series cable has big fat MOLDED-ON XLR connectors, the presence of which creates with two drawbacks.  First, if they break you can't fix them and you just have to cut them off and replace them.  Second, when you pull a Shure SM-57 or SM-58 size mic out of the stand adapter these fat molded connectors don't slide as smoothly through the stand adapter as a standard Switchcraft type connector would.\n\nWhen these connectors go bad, you could buy a new Switchcraft connector and solder it on which would void the warranty, but the cable is not user serviceable otherwise.  Since they have a \"LIFETIME\" warranty on all Monster products, instead of fixing it you can get it replaced free and I'm of the opinion that this warranty is why this cable costs about twice what it should. Plus you have to do without the cable for a while until you get the replacement.\n\nThere are a multitude of other manufacturers making good reliable mic cables and some have better material quality than the Monster 100. Aside from the Monster lifetime warranty you'd be just as well off with a quality cable from another quality line and in some cases better off.  Some of the other manufacturers also have a lifetime warranty.\n\nThe color coding was a nice idea, but from 30 feet away the tech won't be able to see the little colored insert stripe ring.  3-M Mystic tape is the time proven color coding material anyway.\n\nCables with these molded on type connectors would be more suitable for a permanent installation such as a church or meeting hall or infrequent use than for a band that plays a different room every night.  They are not as durable as one with standard Switchcraft or Neutrik XLR connectors.\n\nIf you must have a Monster mic cable and if you are going to be using the cable a lot, or using it in a critical situation I'd step up at least to the 500 series or try another reliable name brand like Planet Waves or the Horizon brand which are very well made.  I've also had good luck with the Shure brand cables which is a very economical solution.\n\nThere are also a number of small companies selling custom made Mogami or Canare mic cables.  Just do an internet search on Mogami mic cable.  In many recording studios you can usually find Mogami and/or Canare brand cables.\n\nI do use the pricier Monster instrument cables which are worth at least some of the extra money to me.  I own two of those and they have been good cables.  These Series 100 Microphone cables are better than nothing, but no cable is 100% failsafe so I'd keep a spare handy.  You are paying a premium price but don't expect cables that never fail."

        "reviewText": "The first rule of microphones is that, \"No one microphone is perfect for every purpose.\"  Rule two is, \"Experiment with different mics in different applications to find your signature sound.\"  I've used Shure SM58's along with their ancestors and relatives back to 1968.  I primarily used them for broadcasting and recording spoken word content but I have used (and still do use) them for singing some back up vocals.\n\nThe SM58 does one thing well and that is vocal performance when used very close to the mouth for public address use.  Some people, me included, actually sound better and more comfortable in a live performance setting when using another mic, the Shure SM-57.  The SM-58 is a very good vocal mic and for some people probably the best choice.  For example, anyone who can not resist putting the mic right up against their lips while singing will probably want the SM-58.  People with softer or weaker voices will want the SM-58.\n\nThe SM-58 is highly directional and has a noticeable yet manageable proximity effect (which means the bass increases the closer you get.)  This mic does not pick up well from much over 8 inches away.  The reason so many singers think you are supposed to shove microphones practically inside your mouth is because the ball type Shure vocal mics require you to get them very close or they don't sound right.  On the other hand, the SM-57 sounds best several inches away from the user's mouth and works fine up to 12 inches away.  While the SM-58 is certainly the number one professional PA vocal mic, there are precious few other uses for it because it has a colored sound with a prominent frequency response boost in the upper midrange plus a sound source has to be very close before it is picked up clearly.  It works ok for conga drums and the like, but the SM-58 is about the last thing you'd want to use to mic a sax or guitar.  Personally these mics are not the best for my mic technique or the basic nature my voice, but for some people they sound great.  The live vocal mic that works best for me is the Shure SM-57 with a windscreen.  However for other people the SM-58 works better.  It depends on your voice and what you want the mic to do.  If you have a very deep voice, the SM-58 might be the second best choice after the SM-57 which has a better low frequency response.\n\nOne certain advantage of the SM-58 is the excellent gain before feedback capability.  This mic can be turned up louder than almost any other mic without that annoying PA squeal.  Another advantage of the SM-58 is that it is still available (at a slight extra cost) with a built-in on/off switch.  The SM-58's ball shaped grills are very sturdy and even if you should dent one you can get a replacement which screws right on for about ten dollars.  I've seen SM-58's dented, rusty, dusty, smoked up, spit into, with pieces missing and slammed into a hardwood stage with the full weight of a boom stand adding mass to the fall and yet I've never seen but one stop working and that malfunction was due to an on/off switch that got dirt in it.\n\nAll the pro-line Shure mics are top quality.  The pro line Shures also hold their value well.  If you buy one and decide you don't like it, you can get about what you paid for it on eBay.  I would compare as many mics as possible before buying one.  Senneheiser's EVOLUTION mics sound really good too and are worth a look. The SM-58 will be the number one on-stage vocal mic for the foreseeable future because most people follow the crowd instead of actually trying out different mics and picking the one that works best for their particular voice.  These things are so durable that even if they stopped making them today they'd still be around for another 20 years at least."

The mic consistently has some muddiness around 250...but if you just cut the lows, you're good to go. I also find that the high end isn't as pristine as more expensive dynamic mics...but that doesn't bother me so much, as some of that warmth can help my voice sit better in the mix.\n\nEvery qualified sound man knows exactly what to do with this mic, it's consistent, and darn near bullet proof.

It does mute the sound for a week or two, but if you want something that works for the long term, look elsewhere."

It is no longer the audiphile steal of the decade, and thus needs to be juxtaposed to its competition.\n\nFurthermore, it requires a very low mass tonearm to get the right resonance synergy due to the very high compliance and low downforce.  All Technics and most Rega arms, for instance, are mid-mass.\n\nFor a hundred bucks a replacement tip nowadays, you might as well get into mid-compliance moving coil designs, which by their very nature have extremely low effective tip mass due to there being only coils rather than heavier magnets on the cantilever end on the other side of the pivot inside.  You can't replace the stylus yourself on an MC, but you're practically paying the cost of a whole new cart on the 440MLa anyway at these prices.\n\nAs was also proven with the Shure V15 series before it, the diamond cut and cantilever material can be instrumental in giving a moving magnet/moving iron design low effective tip mass, but there is a diminishing return.  MC designs with such improvements are even lower tip mass.  If the price ever comes back down on the replacement tips to a reasonable price, then certainly snatch them up.  It's an incredible MM design."

Exceptionally tight bass that poo poos all over anything by Sony (700, V6/7506, 7509), Koss, or Ixos, and the mids and highs are nicely balanced.  There's a slight (and I do mean slight) excess of bass, but it's in a way that lends itself to mixing and is never muddy and muffled.  Etymotic's high end in-ear stuff obviously does better on the bass (as well as everywhere else) but that's a different beast.  Unfortunately, the 1000's break.  First thing to go is usually the slide joint.  You'll notice they keep slipping on one side (left usually) and tightening the screw will eventually strip it.  The solution is to superglue the sliders (open them up completely) then tape the outside with scotch tape, which is nearly invisible.  A perfect solution, assuming you won't ever get to adjust the size again to anyone else's head.  However, that's not the biggest problem.  The plastic between the ball joint and the horseshoe shaped piece that contacts the driver housing will eventually crack and break completely.  This usually occurs on the right side more, though by that time you'll see cracking on the left, too.  It can happen out of nowhere one day and is catastrophic.  For the price, this is totally unacceptable construction on Pioneer's part.  They have been replacing them like gangbusters to people who have the problem, but you pay the shipping cost and there's no end to the number of headphones you'll go through.  As far as I know, they haven't fixed it.  Mine just went after only about 6 months.  There are people on the Pioneer forum on their 5th one.  They sound that good and work that well for DJing, but at this point I'm about ready to try the Senn 25.  I've been to Numark hell and back about 11 times, and I don't want to start another cycle with a different product."

I played it for a couple of weeks, hoping the flaws would stop bothering me, but I finally realized I just had to overlook too much to feel okay keeping it. I sent it back.\n\nFirst of all, the good things. It sounded good, really good, what with the P90s and the fully hollow body. I think the Casino Elitist sounded better, a little richer and more solid, but it was close; really they were both good sounds, just different, almost coming down to personal preference. And the action felt good, too, low and fast. The quality of the woodwork was good overall, except for a clumsily-cut curve in the headstock, which disappointed me because, to my eye, this nice little arc carved on each side of the headstock is part of the iconic design of the Casino, a nice little detail that sets it apart from its Gibson cousins. The polyurethane finish was well done, smooth and even.\n\nBut the stain was another story. It was applied in blotches, and you could see streaks and sponge marks where the stain had been allowed to dry too much before wiping off, or something of this nature. Streaky, ugly, blotchy. Not good.\n\nThe pots appeared to be cheap, and when you twisted them, they wobbled on their axis rather than spinning straight. This did not inspire confidence; I feared for their longevity.\n\nBut the frets were the deal killer. The fret job was abandoned halfway to completion. Maybe they thought nobody would notice. Maybe a lot of people wouldn't. Here's what they did: the frets were pressed into the fingerboard, the ends smoothed off, and the frets were leveled with a file or belt sander. Then some worker began the job of crowning the frets with a fret file . . . and there it ended, throw the guitar in a box and ship it out the door. The crowning was never completed, so the tops of the frets were not properly rounded, but were left way too flat, too wide. And the file (or belt sander) marks had not been sanded smooth, so the harshly flat tops of all the frets had ridges in them like corduroy! Imagine what that feels like when you play it. Bend a string and instead of a nice smooth feel--and sound--you get this grinding feel, and a grinding sound as well. It was kind of funny, kind of funky in a dime-store cheapo guitar way, like some $29 Woolworth guitar one of those old real roots Chicago blues guys might have played back in the '50s . . . but for a guitar at this price point, a guitar that's trying to be a real grown-up guitar instead of a toy guitar--this is completely unacceptable. Laughable really, deserving of scorn. Where was quality control? Or is this the standard the once-proud Epiphone company has set for itself? I will never know the answer, but I do know I will never risk buying one of these junkers again. It cost me over 80 bucks to ship this guitar and case back to the online store I bought it from--they shipped the guitar and case separately, so two boxes, two FedEx bills--so, expensive experiment.\n\nToo bad, because I really wanted to like this guitar."

On top of that I have also done work as a mobile DJ and have used various microphones, so I do know what I am talking about when I say that, even for the price, there are better options on the market.\n\nInitially, I started using my own Shure PG48 (not the SM58) in place of one of the R21's that had been used for vocals, switching it over instead to amplify an acoustic guitar. The R21 did well when it came to amplifying acoustic instruments, so I was able to find a use for them, while using my entry-level Shure for vocals and just regular speaking, which that handled a lot better.\n\nThen, when I purchased a portable Behringer sound system, their XM1800S microphone came with it, so I was introduced to that. The XM1800S also comes in a three pack that's about $5 less, but it gets compared to the Shure SM58, with some professionals preferring it to the standard Shure microphone. So, I ordered the three pack of XM1800S, and am keeping the Samson R21's strictly as instrument microphones.\n\nI want to end this review by saying I don't hate the Samson R21 mics. They just weren't cutting it on vocals, but they have done well when it comes to instruments. As anything, it really depends on what you're using it for, but if you take my advice, use the R21 for instruments, use the Behringer XM1800S for vocals and save yourself $5. You'll be happy you did."

So while I didn't purchase it, it's been in my possession for the last three years, and it's been in use on a fairly consistent basis since.\n\nFirst of all, it is a Shure microphone. While technology is quickly closing the gap between inexpensive and expensive equipment, the one thing I can say about this microphone that I can't say about many (not all) other low-cost dynamic microphones is that it feels solid when it's held. If it falls to the floor I don't have to worry about it being damaged. Any Shure I've ever used has felt the same way.\n\nSecond, it is an entry level microphone. Don't expect the PG48 XLR to perform like Shure's more famous SM57 or SM58. While they may be the same brand, they certainly are not the same microphones. Shure is clear in their product description that the best uses for the PG48 XLR are for public address and karaoke performances. In my experience I've found this description to be accurate.\n\nThird, if you are looking for performance microphones at a low-cost, there are a couple I could easily recommend that, while they aren't Shure, will more than get the job done. As I mentioned previously technology is quickly closing the gap between brands like Shure to brands like Behringer. Since this is a review about the Shure PG48 XLR though, just ask me for my recommendations in the comment section.\n\nThe last thing I'll say is the PG48 XLR is a good entry level microphone regardless of who makes it. Given its proper setting and application it's more than adequate to make public announcements or to sing to a group of 50 or less. In such settings there's no need to go the more expensive route, even within the Shure family. Just don't expect to be able to play in a rock band with it, because it's not that kind of microphone."

This is the first set where all the strings are wound & the resulting sound is .... just okay\nI thought the treble strings would be silver wound & be very bright so i thought it may be a good match for my lutheir built flamenco guitar. strangely the trebles are wound in plastic. The sound of these plastic trebles is somewhat like hearing the upper frets of the wound bass strings. For example, the 1st e strings sounds like holding the 14thfret on the D string.\nI cant imagine them being suitable for any classical performance. Maybe for a flamenco sound or even a unique pop guitar tone. the sound is somewhere between nylon strings & steel. not as mellow as nylon & Not as bright as steel. It may work well with a dark sounding guitar if u want a different brighter,percussive snappy sound. However note that these strings are not extremely different from a general savarez high tension set. Just a little snappier but with lots of squeak cos of the wound trebles.\nHere's my only complaint : the finger squeak is unbearable ! i cant imagine using it for a studio recording (no one can listen to every string squeaking)even if u have very clean technique."

When they say it has a \"select spruce top\", what that means is that it's a laminate, like plywood, not solid wood. The top is the single most important part of the guitar.  How it vibrates gives the guitar its sound.  Laminates are very stiff, and will not resonate well.  And when they tell you the sound will \"improve with age and playing\"?  If it were solid spruce or ceder, that would be true, but a laminate will sound the same 20 years later.  Yamaha and Fender make inexpensive solid spruce guitars.  $200. or less.  Do yourself a favor. Get a solid spruce top. The  difference in sound is impressive."

        "reviewText": "It is so hard to get an honest review of any mike that isn't a Shure SM58. This is considered the gold standard by which all others are measured. Of course at least part of this reputation is deserved, but perhaps more for the durability of the SM58 than its sound. I have a couple of SM58s and a couple of PG58s. I was considering the SM48, but the PG58 has slightly better specs, and almost identical price.\n\nThe first thing I noticed out of the box was that the PG58 is slightly bigger and slightly heavier. It also has a different switch than the SM58. The metal screens protecting them aren't interchangeable. I then plugged in one microphone cable so the settings would be identical. I tried both mikes, one after the other, first with speaking and then with singing and playing guitar, and then I changed the settings, or more specifically, the effects and the EQ on the PA. I repeated the experiment, speaking and then singing while changing between mikes.\n\nHere's what I noticed: The SM58 is slightly flatter in the mid range. The PG58 is slightly brighter and has a touch more presence. They are about equal on volume. The slight differences in tone can be easily manipulated with an EQ or just ordinary tone controls. Neither was susceptible to much feedback or vocal pop.\n\nI haven't tried out this side by side comparison in a live situation or even in practice, as it's too time consuming and interferes with playing. It's difficulty to judge in those situations too, or at least awkward, but I have used a combination of the two in practice and no one seems to be able to tell the difference, except one person actually expressed a preference for the PG58, but that could be just the settings.\n\nI looked at the specs for the two mikes side by side. The SM58 is a little flatter in response, especially at the high end, over 10K Hz, and it picks up a few dB before the PG 58, somewhere between 50 and 60 Hz. However, since the human vocal range is generally between around 300 and 3000 Hz, neither of these seems likely to have much effect, although the SM58 might be a tad more responsive for a bass singer.\n\nI also tried out two different Behringer mikes and a Radio Shack mike. The Behringer 8500 was totally outclassed by both of the Shures, sounding tinny and thin and with little presence or volume. I tried out a Behringer 2000XM and was impressed by the similarity. These mikes sound almost identical (The B 2000 and the Shure SM). The Behringer 2000XM seems to have been discontinued, though, and replaced with the 1800XM, an inferior mike offered in bundles of three for under $50.\n\nI then plugged in a Radio Shack mike that was a spare backup, not even taken out for practice. The model number is 33-3001, probably also discontinued. This was an excellent sounding mike, with good volume, presence and tone.\n\nI didn't have any other mikes to test in this side by side experiment, but I did reach some conclusions:\nThere is quite a bit of snobbery in choosing microphones, with the Shure SM58 held up as some unreachable standard. They ARE sturdy, and they are good mikes and the price is not unreasonable, at around $100. However, there are other microphones which sound nearly identical and are also sturdy and reliable, at lower prices, including the Shure PG58, and most likely the SM48, though I didn't have any of those to test.\n\nI wish more people would give unbiased reviews based on actual performance instead of condescension toward those who are either on a budget or looking for alternatives to the standard bearer. I'm giving this 4 stars only because I haven't had enough time to give an evaluation of how this holds up in comparison to the SM58."

I am fairly intelligent, with several college degrees, but only a fair amount of electronic technical knowledge and experience. I wanted a simple way to use this drum machine to enhance my solo playing, and it took me several sessions to pore over the technical explanations for all the ways the machine can be used.\n\nI only want to use pre-existing patterns and modify them slightly, mostly the tempo and then just activate that using the footswitch and stop it the same way. I know this doesn't produce the most professional results and doesn't exactly match up with all the nuances of a song, but I just don't have the patience to program the drum and bass parts for each song individually. Added to this is that I may not play the song exactly the same way every time. There may be slight variations in my performance, and I embrace these, as that is part of live music.\n\nI finally deciphered how to do this and to save (record) my \"songs\"--really just pre-set patterns with the tempo modified, and to name them so I can play any song I want by just selecting the song from my list. It may not be perfect, but it works for me and I'm not a technician, and don't really want a technician for live performances at small clubs and parties. I want a drummer and an unobtrusive bass player, and that is what I get with the Alesis SR 18. I can select the drum set I want and the type of bass, and can even transpose the key for the bass, but so far all I have done is select these as default settings so that all my songs use the same kit. It's fine for me and my limited use.\n\nThe sound, though, is much superior to the Zoom RT 223 I had been using. That machine has more patterns (over 400), but fewer usable ones, and some that were really annoying. The Alesis has just 100 patterns in the \"A\" list, and slight variations of those in the \"B\" list, and some fairly subtle fills that you can activate with the dual footswitch. These usually are in and out, meaning it will lead into a change (for instance into a bridge) and then out of that bridge and back into the main part of the song. I use them sparingly. Mostly I stick to start and stop once I've selected and modified the pattern for my song.\n\nI know this is an anti-technical way to use this machine, but it works for me, and I suspect will work for others who don't want to spend all their music time programming a machine, but prefer to play with some reasonable accompaniment that is easy to access.\n\nTo sum up, it is a great sounding machine with immense technical possibilities, and it takes some effort to decipher the instructions, especially if you, like me, are interested mainly in an easy to use, good sounding drum and bass backup."

The actual pad itself measures 16.25\" long by 17.0\" tip-to-tip on the wide end, and 13.5\" tip-to-tip on the narrow end. The important thing to know is that for it to work as designed, one of the flaps needs to be resting against the inside of the drum head at a fairly steep up-angle, so that it can \"bounce\" away from the head when it's struck, and then settle back to rest against the head again to dampen the ringing. This means that with the EQ Pad you will only be able to muffle either the batter head or the resonant head, but not both. It seems that the pad is really designed to work behind the batter head, so, the resonant head could still need something else for ring control.\n\nAs another reviewer mentioned, you will not get that deep, pillow sound with this pad. But then, that's not what it's intended to do.\n\nAs far as the Velcro not sticking, mine stuck fine. I thoroughly dry-dusted the inside of the shell first, paying special attention to the area where the Velcro would mount. You could even do a light wipe-down with rubbing alcohol on a rag to prepare the surface first. I would just be sure to let it air dry completely before sticking down the Velcro pads.\n\nFor my purposes, although the EQ Pad worked as Evans designed it to, in the end I wound up using a small pillow instead to get the \"warm thud\" sound I wanted. But the EQ pad is definitely worth trying out. Maybe in the future I'll find another drum that it's perfect for."

The approximately 3 dollar price difference is not, for me, worth the lesser satisfaction, even on my least expensive ukes. Considering how seldom one usually changes uke strings, the higher-priced Aquila's still seem to be worth the extra couple of bucks. Use the Martin's (or any cheaper string) when you are working on your uke, put the stress of repeatedly de-tuning and re-tuning on them. Then switch to Aquila's for playing. Some may like the Martins but few won't love the Aquila's."

I sold off my rat and tried out a number of other distortion boxes at a local shop and settled on the Big Muff Pi. This thing is rich. The complexity of the distortion is incredible compared to what you get with most other pedals--must be the brilliant Russian engineering behind it. It has three knobs: Volume, Sustain, and Tone. The Volume is obvious, the sustain is really the distortion level. For the Bass, I run the sustain very low, and the volume higher and get a great mix of clean and distorted tone. Sometimes I run the sustain knob turned all the way off and this thing still drives the sound nicely. Too much distortion on the bass and you loose your ability to cut through the rest of the band in my opinion. The Tone knob adjusts the center frequency of the distortion. I run mine way over to the left and distort the low end around 200-400 kHz. You can crank it around and get anything from a low grumbly distortion tall the way to a really tinny irritating heavy metal sound. This thing is versatile, and no matter how you like your settings, the distortion it produces is rich in harmonic overtones, multi-dimensional, and unlike any other boxes I've tried. Highly recommended.\n\nMy only complaint is that this box is designed to work only on battery power--no AC adapter at all. Fortunately now there's an adapter from One-Spot that can be connected to a battery lead and then to an AC adapter. Hopefully Amazon will start carrying that soon."

Nice job guys! Great interface)from my laptop in a live scenario playing for about 1,000 people at a time. I struggled to get an even mix using the Motif Inputs to receive a good signal from my Berringer UCA202 (a fine sounding little monster, if I must say so). So, I thought I would get a yamaha submixer and just balance it from a little mixer board, so I wouldn't spend a bunch of time trying to get a stable signal from my laptop through the Motif Xf inputs. Along comes this device showing up for about the cost of the Berringer UCA202. The reviews were great! It looked small and compact, and I wouldn't need another power cord for a sub mixer. Got the item. What a piece of crap!! The knobs, to begin with, did not turn smoothly. (two of them by the way. They felt like they were having some resistance to movement, badly) Oh well, no biggy. It looks like something you would build out of the '70's from Radioshack. (Yes I saw the pictures before I bought it. I know, but it was much more dorky when it arrived). None of that really mattered to me at all. All I cared about was the functionality of it, because it would sit on the floor by my keyboard while I performed. So I plugged it in, and got right to work balancing a decent signal to send to the soundman. It clips like crazy!! The peak indicator (means it's clipping. That bugs the heck out of me, and I won't stand for it), lights up when there is the slightest variation in volume (velocity change for piano or swell for the B3 Organ). VB3 is a fat, rich sounding Softsynth organ created, not from samples, but from the genuine sound architecture of the original Hammond products using pure tones and effects (Thanks Guido from Italy! You are awesome!!). Alright, so I will turn down my gear. It resulted in sending a weak signal even with the master up considerably. Okay, so I will increase the channel volume, since I don't want a hot signal from my gear to cause distortion. No go. Clips again. I'm not done working with this garbage. I don't give up that easily. I just have to say, that the hardware is not good, and the signal routing/handling is sketchy at best. I know that this would not be the case had I purchased what I was originally intending. I will pay the other 40 bucks for a real piece of hardware. Maybe I'll have a better update later. For now, I am very disappointed. Sorry Nady, but I say NOdee.\n\nUpdate:\nMy son just educated me on the rating issue. When people's good reviews include the term \"...for the price\" it means \"better than I thought for a cheap piece of junk.\""

Yes, I may have gotten one that was defective, but I don't think so. Looked fine. Plastic just snapped right in half.\n\n[edit] After reading some of the other reviews, I want to add that there is a chance what another reviewer is true.

Didn't come close to fitting on my pinky. Slid halfway on and 2nd knuckle stopped it cold. I really liked it. I wanted it to work. I am going to send back and order the large. That might fit my pinky, but if they all run small I am doubting it would fit my middle finger.  Otherwise it appears very nice. Like a Maserati with no engine, however."

I'd never bought official 'dulcimer' strings before and was surprised to find what those were. Maybe its just me and the way I play (40+ years), but these are very heavy (thick) strings and I kept having to retune as they kept stretching as I played (I have peg tuners and they did not wind tight). I play a lot and these were just awkward and clunky sounding. After half an hour I put my old ones back on and will keep these as an emergency backup. I only use three strings, and buy the thinnest strings I can find at a guitar store - .008s for 1st and 2nd string, and the thinnest wound string the store has for the 3rd. The wound string I just bought was 3x as thick as what I normally use, and I know it could not be tuned as high as I sometimes go with that string and still be flexible. I fret all three strings and pick, have lots of different tunings I use, and my preferred thin stings have a nice clean sound, lots of range, can bend a note. Can't say that for the new ones, but they were cheap and may serve a purpose some day. I guess the best I can say is - because of all the 'good' reviews - now I know what 'official' dulcimer strings are like, and suppose these will be fine if you like very thick strings. (You should try thin ones though!)"

        "reviewText": "When I received this Epiphone LP Special II Les Paul Electric Guitar, Vintage Sunburst I discovered there are cracks in the wooden body, under the paint. I can tell that the wood was cracked before it was painted because the paint flows into the crack in one instance on the back, is visible up over the \"shoulder\" close to the strap peg and can be seen under the paint on the front. In another instance the paint bridges a crack on back below the cutout shoulder and can be seen under the paint in the right light front and back. Is this normal? (There was no sign of shipping damage on either the outer carton or on the inner product box). Regarding playing, the bass strings buzz on the frets when fretted (not my fingers) which probably can be corrected by adjusting the bridge. I was under the impression that Epiphone guitars were ready to use right out of the box. I have contacted Epiphone/Gibson company to advise on the cracks and the buzzing bass strings. I am concerned that the cracks may get worse, and if this is this normal for a guitar in this low price range made in china. I got a reply from Gibson Customer Service which said \"We would need to see pictures, but it would be highly unusual if there actually were cracks in the wood. The set up on an instrument can shift during shipping and handling, so a new instrument may need to be set-up.\" I will probably return this instrument and buy one in person from a music store where I can see and try the product before buying it.\n\nUpdate:11-12-15. I discovered another crack in the vicinity off one of the screws that holds the neck on. I sent several pictures to Gibson Products/Epiphone a few days ago but have yet to receive a reply. It seems to be a pretty good guitar but I expected it to not be cracked. Guitar was made in China. Photos attached."

If you use any textured or raised-lettered picks, sliding one out will result in one or two more coming out with it... and not just falling out. They will EJECT out. To make my situation a little more complicated, I use the new Petrucci Dunlop Jazz III picks, which not only are a little smaller than standard picks, but have a raised logo on them that \"grabs\" the pick beneath it as it slides out. The older Dunlop pickholders work much better than this one.\n\nThis pickholder is sleeker looking than the old ones, but it is about a quarter inch taller. I didn't mind that so much, because I could fit a couple more picks into it (five or six 1.5 mm picks).  But it's unusable for me with the picks I play with. I'm going to give them away.

Mine was sold by American Music Outlet. The shipping time was great and it was double boxed.\n\nGuitar: Looks nice and setup and intonation was perfect right out of the box. I was a little surprised by the fact that the neck looks to be unfinished wood.  I'm a little concerned about this and debating as to whether to try to put some type of sealant / finish on it for protection.  There is a minor problem with the tone control on the guitar, but I've spent many years working in electronics and it will be easier to just fix it than return the guitar I think.  These are the type things I've come to expect to have to deal with when you buy imported products online cheap.\n\nI think a new set of strings will improve the performance immensely.  The stock strings sound ok but they seem to be very course wound and are pretty noisy when you move your fingers on them.  I may put a set of flats on it.  The neck has a minor little cosmetic nick or two in the wood, but they have no effect on its playing and are basically invisible unless your are inspecting it very closely from inches away.  The guitar is a nice weight and the neck unexpectedly thin, which is nice if you have smaller hands as I do. It is a very attractive instrument overall and plays very nicely.\n\nAmp: It is a 10 watt practice amp, and that is basically what it is good for.  You might get enough volume to play with a small acoustic group (which is what I do), but it you are going to play with other amplified instruments, plan on buying a real amp. The amp does look fairly well made, and has EQ controls and a headset jack.  It has a nice sound, just not overly loud.  There is some hum but I believe this to be from the cheap cable supplied with it.  In my case it could also be coming from the problem with the tone control mentioned above.\n\nAccessories: As stated in other reviews, the accessories are nothing to write home about.  The case fits well and the zipper works smoothly, but has absolutely no padding. It will keep the dust off and give you a carrying handle, but that's about it. The strap is about a $10 nylon strap...you'll probably want something more comfortable if you plan on playing much.  As mentioned earlier, the cable from the guitar to the amp is a very cheap one.  It probably causes hum and at best will not hold up very long. I have a bunch of good cables, so that's not really an issue.  The tuner supplied works fine.  Put the batteries in, switch the switch to \"Bass\" and tune for the green lights on the appropriate string notes.  Mine was very close to being in tune out of the box, just a slight bit low on all strings. The tuners on the guitar work smoothly.  I haven't even looked at the DVD, but according to other reviews, it is not all that great.  I bought this package for the guitar and amp, so the accessories are not really that big of a concern to me. I will throw a tip in...there is a very good, complete beginners course available online at studybass.com, and it is absolutely free.\n\nOverall: I stole this for $131 shipped! Last one at that price. These are going online from $169.95 to $199.95.  Considering that, I would say that I'm pretty pleased with it. It's well worth what I paid, even with having to make a minor repair. If you're looking to pick up a playable bass and practice amp on the cheap, its probably a decent buy at the $169 range.  If I were going to spend much more than that, however, I think I would probably go with the Peavey guitar/amp package that sells for around $100 more. The main reason being that it comes with a bigger amp that would probably be a little more versatile for things other than practice."

That's about the best thing I can say about the Beta 58.  It can take a beating and probably not fail.  The sound quality will suffer as several beat up Beta 58's I've used sounded like there was a rag wrapped around the mic but it got the job done in a pinch.\n\nAs I started working with other vocalists who brought their own mics to shows, I noticed that none of them really used the beta 58.  Most of them preferred either the EV ND767a, the Sennheiser e935a or the Sure Beta 87a.  The differences between these mics and the \"house 58's\" was astonishing... even 58's in very good condition (never been dropped or abused) did not sound as clear as the EV/SENN's.\n\nThe biggest difference though is the feedback from stage monitors.  The Senn and EV both have much better feedback rejection than any of the 58's I've seen.\n\nAll in all, I've been pretty underwhelmed with the 58.  For around the same price there are much better choices.\n\nI know that different venues, singers, PA setups, different stage monitors, etc all can affect how a mic performs but my observations are based on hearing pretty much the same traits over and over so they are not based on isolated incidents and I also base this all on the performance of new or like new 58's, not the beat up ones."

I have yet to upgrade, so it is frustrating, cause this bad boy has no bells and whistles. that said, for a young person recording at home, this is perfect for the first few years of making music, though now you can pony up like 200 and get something far superior. this is good to learn on, it has step recording which I used a little, then ran out of patience, lol. It has a nice live recording setup where you set up how many measures you want, then can add and take out sounds as it is going, so that's cool, and you can make some complex stuff that way, or just try to emulate a real drummer, which is tough with a drum machine cause you immediately start doing stuff a drummer could never do, like hi hat/snare/cymbal/some other sound, but hey, it's not against the law.....yet, lol. bottom line, for a young rock person that needs a beat to record over, this hits the spot, for others, like electronic music people and rock people (like me) it can be limiting. the snare sounds are unfortunate, though I imagine that is an issue with most drum machines till you get to a certain price point."

It's really not bad and it's a solid beginner's guitar with some room for improvement.  I found the neck to be decent, the pickups workable, and overall build pretty solid.  But that's it.  For nearly $300 you get a decent guitar that nearly every other beginner ever has used at some point.\n\nAll of which is fine, and I could end my review here.  But odds are, if you're seriously looking at this guitar, you're a beginner or intermediate player, perhaps looking for an upgrade from your Squier Bullet Strat or cheap Wal-Mart acoustic.  This is an extremely popular model because it's made by a subsidiary of one of the most famous guitar companies in the world.  And if you're like I was at one point, you might not have even heard of any of the comparable alternatives.\n\n1)  Schecter\nI own a Schecter Omen 6, purchased at $300 even, and it blows the Epiphone out of the water in terms of speed, playability, and sexiness.  It could have been the luck of the draw, but I do feel that Schecter makes a superior guitar at just a fraction of the cost more than this one.\n\n2)  Rondo Music\nIf you are indeed a beginner, you probably haven't even heard of Rondo Music.  They aren't as well known because they spend nothing on advertising or brand naming.  All that money saved goes directly into quality, and boy does it show.  You have two general groups of options if you're looking for a Rondo alternative to the Epi LP-100:\n\na)  SX Callisto (or other SX) - SX guitars are made in China and can be found ridiculously cheap (the most expensive custom models top out at $200) and will likely match, if not outperform, the Epiphone and save you $100 as well.  I just ordered an SX Callisto Custom at $160 yesterday - it has a set neck compared to the Epi's bolt-on, block inlays compared to the Epi's dots, quilted maple top compared to the Epi's plain top, and at under 2/3 the cost.\n\nb)  Agile - Rondo's Agile guitars are less common than Epiphones, but have developed quite a cult following, for good reason.  An Agile AL-2500 series guitar (see pic) costs between $250 and $300 and will typically match an Epiphone Les Paul Standard Plus top, which runs about double the cost.  Go even higher up, and an Agile AL-3200 will compete with Gibsons and Fenders - without paying for the name (or American labor costs).\n\nThis isn't to trash the Epiphone.  It's a decent guitar and generally quite solid and reliable.  If brand name means a lot to you, then by all means, get the Epiphone.  I simply feel that you're putting at least a hundred dollars into the name on the headstock, and that there are definitely better alternatives at the price that you should check out.\n\nQuick takeaway - Unless the name on the headstock means everything to you, an Agile AL-2500 is a far superior guitar at about the same price.\n\n(Absolutely no compensation was given from Schecter or Rondo music - I just happen to like their products and wanted to share some advice to make the world a better place!)\n\nHope I was able to help you out, good luck with all your guitar endeavors in the future :)\n\n- Matt"

Never did I have a single complaint about it. And I had it with me everywhere I went until I was almost 40 years old.\n\nMy son was an avid electric guitar player who wanted to give acoustic a try. Since I didn't have time to play my guitar during that time of my life I LENT my guitar to him. When I eventually had more free time and wanted to get back into my music I asked my son to please return my guitar, the one I let him BORROW. It was at that time he informed me that he SOLD it to a buddy when he needed money buy a Fender bass. Kids...\n\nSo...I bought this one and am very happy to have a Yamaha Classical Guitar back in my possession. The only differences I can see between my old one and this one are the colors and design around the sound hole and the absence of Yamaha on the headstock. To be sure this was the brand of classical guitar I wanted, I tried several different brands and models available on Amazon.com at local guitar stores.\n\nEvery other brand of classical guitar, regardless of the price, did not hold up to the sound of the Yamaha guitars. I'm not saying the other brands did not sound good. What I'm saying is the Yamahas sounded great. Should I ever decide to upgrade to a better classical guitar, I will stay with Yamaha.\n\nI could not find a lower price for this model than the Amazon.com price...anywhere. Having the Free Shipping option was a major plus.\n\nThere is only one reason I needed to call the Yamaha Customer Support Line. I needed to ask where the serial number is located. I couldn't find it to save my life. On the C40, look inside the sound hole to the inside edge of the fretboard.\n\nMy guitar was wrapped very well for shipping. It came with \"The Yamaha Guitar Quickstart DVD.\" The DVD has some very useful information to help you get started if you have no idea what to do with your guitar once you take it out of the box. A \"Welcome\" sheet with some good basics for beginners was also included.\n\nIt is so good to have another Yamaha Classsical Guitar back in my life."

It doesn't work as smoothly as the pedals do on an acoustic piano, which is what I'd always used. Doesn't have the same feel either. Nowhere close.\n\nIn my opinion, a sustain pedal like the M-Audio SP-2 Sustain Pedal with Piano Style Action or other similar pedal is a much better choice. The price difference is only a few dollars and the feel and action are so much better. The only thing I've found the Yamaha FC-5 Sustain Pedal is good for is taking up space in a drawer where I keep my electric guitar pedals."

To be frank, this guitar sounds terrible when compared to a quality Fender.  Adjusted the action, set the intonation, replaced the tuners then the pickups, and it still sounds un-bearingly bad.  In my opinion, the problem is in the wood.  It just doesn't resonate.  Again, the guitar looks great and plays great.  The neck is great.  But that tinny, stinging tone is awful.  Thought about making more mods i.e. wiring, pots, bridge, nut, etc. but it's just not worth it.  This guitar is completely unusable for a working musician.  So for anyone on the fence, trying to decide...Squier?..Fender?....You do get what you pay for."

If, on the other hand, you're a tone snob who believes that anything other than overhyped and overpriced boutique pedals is garbage, you're probably not looking at this page to begin with. Don't get me wrong, I have some nice boutique pedals and mods (like the Cusack Screamer and the Keeley MT-2) that I would never part with. But here's the thing...the stock DS-1 stands proud even in such company. Why? A few simple observations:\n\n1) Boss has been selling this pedal with great success since 1978, regardless of the fact that...\n\n2) Due to the toughness, you'll likely never need to replace one of these tanks.\n  2a) There is a profusion of overdrive and distortion pedals on the market, both corporate and boutique varieties.\n\n3) Many outstanding guitar players have used this pedal in the studio and on the road, including Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, John Petrucci, etc... Sure, some are using \"modified\" versions now, like Vai's Keeley edition. But you don't tamper with what you don't like. If the foundation isn't solid, you replace it. I also own the Ibanez Vai Jemini pedal and what they basically did (in my opinion) was take his tube screamer and DS-1 pedals and put them into one box for convenience. Same thing with Satriani's Vox Satchurator pedal. You know someone really loves a pedal when they use it as a template in designing their own signature line. I don't have any proof that they did this, but it does sound like it in a side-by-side comparison.\n\n4) Now consider that the Jemini and Satchurator are $199 and $129, respectively. Nice pedals? Yes. Worth up to four times the DS-1? After using both for a few months, I'm not entirely convinced of that. Since I'm a pedal collector, they're staying put in my house. But I don't see a whole lot in them that really blows away the core DS-1 sound.\n\nSeriously, if you're looking for a simple, set and forget distortion that has a good basic tone for rock and metal, the Boss DS-1 is a great value. If you simply must have crystalline tone purity in a box, why are you still reading this? Get outta here already ;-)"

It IS plainly designated as a sax strap, but I was directed to it while searching for a bassoon strap. Still, I tried it on my tenor sax and I would have the same complaints if I'd purchased it for that instrument. First of all, it claims to be XL. It isn't; it's barely long enough for alto sax or a tenor played by a small person. Second, it's not quickly adjustable; if you play only one instrument, that wouldn't matter, but a strap at this price should be more practically designed. Third and most important, the clip is plastic junk! It won't stand up to professional or avid amateur use for long. And it's too fat! The hook won't slip into the typical metal eyes on most instruments, or it slips in only partially and therefore insecurely. Look for something else, musician friends!

It does have adjustable volume and tone controls, but there is a buzzing sound with the bass notes that are played on my son's guitar.  We bought it for our 11 year old for his birthday and it is okay for him to practice with, but that is all I recommend it for.  At least it will be easy to carry and take with him on any trips."

I know a thing or two.\n\n If you're getting this because you're not sure if you, or the person you're gifting this to, really has the interest then by all means get one. However, plan on replacing it fast. It's cheap for a reason and it feels cheap. With guitars, you get what you for up to a certain price point. This is an OK starter guitar for someone who may not have the drive or patience.\n\nIf you're looking at this as a first guitar and you plan on playing, learning, practicing then pass on this. Epiphone makes great guitars and for double the price you get a much better feeling and sounding instrument. I've played on more than of these and a common issue is staying in tune and not sounding right in anyrhing but standard tuning. For examoleexample, if you want to learn metal this guitar will not satisfy you.\n\n The epiphone les paul standard, typically around $300 is where you should go. They fret easier and sound richer. You may also want to check out a fender telecaster modern player around the same price. It's a different feel due to the maple fretboard and really is fantastic for chords - where all beginners should start anyway.\n\nI've gone through a number of guitars since I bought one of these. The lesson learned is when you get to the $300 - $500 you'll get quality not only in build but in comfort and tone.\n\nI love epiphone, but depending on your level of interest in the guitar this particular model may be something to pass on. Go put your hands on one of these at guitar center and then compare to a slightly more expensive lp standard. There's a difference and it does matter. Try various models and pick the one that fits your hands, your body, and whispers \"buy me\". Craigslist is full of blind buys for a reason."

Biggest drawback is the very limited range and the vulnerability to radio interference.  If you keep the transmitter and receiver close (30' or less), and are considerate about placement, they work well enough.  We were using this for an outdoor commercial shoot, into a Zoom audio recorder.  We found that if the receiver was too close to the Zoom, it picked up lots of interference.  The solution was to keep the receiver at least several feet away from the Zoom.  It's also worth mentioning that these units will eat up 9v batteries rather quick.

It has both a visual signal and/or audible chirp when your instrument is in tune which is really nice.  I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that the battery compartment cover has a tendency to fall off with even nominal impact.  This is easily countered by taping the cover on at each battery change, but I think that looks cheap and a functioning battery cover is essential to the fit and finish of a quality product from a company such as boss and should be a given.

The hex pattern on the shaft makes the adjustment somewhat limited. You can't fine tune the angle because of the shape. The other issue I have is that the adjustments get even more limited if you're using a hoop suspension system. At least that's how they are with my Tama mounts. In that case these don't attached to the drum's hoop. They attach to the suspension system instead. One drawback to this is that you get that low end rumble trasfered up from the bass drum. The other is that the clamp doesn't fit on straight. It has to angle back so the next adjustment tooth can grab. This make adjustments very limited as far as aiming the mic. Mine are fitted with SM57's. I can see how these would be fantastic for a live situation. But they are less than ideal for a recording situation."

From reverby integrity-rock to developmentally challenged death-chug, this amp can do it all. If you're stuck in that lonely valley between either playing through that loud tube amp you bought and gigged like twice, or playing through rock-stifling headphones, the Cube will put a smile on your face. And when you're finally ready to let the public at-large know you've mastered \"Sharp-Dressed Man,\" it runs on AA batteries, so you can set up shop at the farmer's market and let these fools know you got the blues something terrible."

I'm still shaking my head in disbelief that I got this guitar for the price. First, the 'tuner' issues that I've been reading about. Replace the strings! I stretched and stretched these things and they would not stay in tune. A set of D'Addario 10's cured that straight away (or whatever you prefer just change them). The tuners aren't the best but they are not to blame, it's the cheap strings. Now, technically if you only play open chords this was playable out of the box. The neck angle was so off the A string rattled no matter how high I set the bridge. The guitar would not intonate due to the ridiculous angle. Yes I could have sent it back but I suspect I would have gotten another just like it. I had to spend about 6 hours shimming the neck AND the nut (Never had to do this to the nut on an electric, not even on a used guitar. The nut slot was cut too deep), as well as working on leveling nearly every fret to make it playable. It required 3 business cards to shim the neck which is the most I've ever had to use. After I got that straight I removed a bit of paint from the neck and set it with wood glue in the pocket and on all the screws. In my opinion this helps a great deal with these and all bolt ons for that matter.\nIf I bought this used none of this would have been a big deal. But as I'm looking at this horrid neck angle and doing all this work I'm steadily staring at the 'QC passed' sticker. Must have been built on a Friday afternoon or something.--- NOW--after I did this it is sweet!!. I play through a Peavey Valveking 100 and it rocks as good as my Strat w/  Duncans and Dimarzios. The quality of the electronics is not sub par at all. After adjusting the pickups screws to match the string height and getting all the horrible wax off them,  I'd argue that this is as good as any Epi I've ever played as far as pups and all, so don't hesitate there because I don't really care for Epis and I'm in love with it. (I bought this to sell mainly, but now????)  The build quality; hmm, if you can do guitar work go for it. Otherwise I'd highly recommend a more expensive model. The $299 models are great right out of the box usually."

I can play many many songs with just these few simple chords and that is why I purchased it and I was hoping my child would see the ease and give it a try, I hope they do. this is a good learning tool for novice players that allow them to play songs in just a few moments, something very few systems do. Many get fustrated tring to play, this item takes away allot of that fustration in learning hand positions and allows them to play a song immediately. Great product for the novice, and the intermediate player and some older players with age may find this simple solution of tired hands easy to compensate for that problem and still play.( one thing I must mention, do not let this be a crutch for learning the correct chords and finger positions. It is so easy it will distract that fact from your learning and make it easy to push one button instead of learning the fingering and you will rely on it to much,Please learn from it and don't rely on it all the time) Still a great product and will indeed help you to learn the finger positions one chord at a time."

Some of the guitar amps sound pretty good, some I don't care for, for example the \"58 tweed B-man\" is supposed to sound like a 59 Fender Bassman. I own a 59 fender bassman and the software amp model doesn't do the original any justice. I did add the fx and bass packs and have not regretted the additional purchase. The bass pack is very useful.\n\nThe amp, cabinet, enclosure, microphone, and fx models do a good job recreating the originals with some exceptions. For $100 dollars and a project studio this software is hard to beat. It has helped me numerous times when I wanted a certain sound for a song and can't spend $$$ for a Marshall jcm 2000, mesa boogie dual rectifier, soldano slo 100, or a plethora of microphones. Also the pre-sets are good. Line 6 did an excellent job of recreating Eddie Van Halen's sound from the early 80's. But you can choose your amp, cainet, enclosure, mic, and fx combo and dial in your own settings specifically tailored to your desires quite easily. I did purchase the expansion Bass and FX packs. The bass cabinets and amps are very nice and the extra effects add quite a bit of room to create.\n\nI use this software on a PC running XP media center. I never had any problems installing, running, or updating the software. The only issue I've ever had with the software was a few years ago. I would plug in to play and all I would get was pure digital distortion every time I strummed my guitar strings. I did some research and discovered that there is a common issue with Guitar Port and my pc xbox 360 game controller working together. For some reason the software from the xbox controller interfered with the software from the guitar port. Before I installed the xbox controller the guitar port worked fine. So I uninstalled the xbox controller and now everything works fine again. This was about two years ago and I haven't looked to see if Line 6 or Microsoft ever resolved the issue, but I leave the game playing to my xbox 360 now and the recording, mixing, and editing to my pc.\n\nI do recommend this product for recording studios. It has helped me achieve sounds that I otherwise would have had to spend thousands of dollars on microphones and amps to achieve."

I bought this set to replace the tapewound flats that came on my Violin Bass. Violin basses are shortscale and naturally thumpy, so I bought these hoping to brighten things up a bit.\n\nI was disappointed in the tone because it was so dark and thumpy. I don't know if I received a defective set but they were only slightly brighter than the tapewounds I replaced. The strings also felt rougher than my Nickel Rounds. They're definitely quieter in terms of finger noise but the nickels were surprisingly easier to slide on.\n\nAt first I thought maybe Violin Basses would have this tone no matter what strings I used. To check this I replaced the half rounds with some Chromes, and what a change it made! It really made the bass sing. They were warm and mellow but still had enough brightness. The Chromes had better sustain, increased output and really made the pickups sound good.\n\nI don't think I'll try half rounds again. If I want something with a lot of punch to really cut through I'll get rounds. Otherwise I'll stick with D'Addario Chromes. Even though they are flats, they're incredibly versatile. They work with a lot of different styles and have a much greater range than these half rounds."

The installation requires that you install your rack mounted devices in between the case and a supplied rod and then use the bolts to make the connections through 3 consecutive holes for each bolt that your device requires. It got a bit tricky because the rod does not easily line up with the holes on the case and holes on my devices, so it took some doing.  However, once done, it appears to offer solid connections and device security.  So overall, I would say it was worth the installation effort."

I bought this with my tailor because it's a very cheap capo and honestly I wanted to try something different than the ones I have now. I figured it's extremely inexpensive and it can live in my Taylors case.\n\nBe warned. This capo can scratch your neck in two different ways.\n\n1. If you use the first hole on the capo which you will be inclined to do. You may scratch your neck because the metal on the capo is coming in contact with your guitar neck. So no matter how tight the elastic is or how thick your guitar neck is you must I repeat must use the second hole for the metal on the first one will be covered by elastic.\n\n2. Taking the cable off the capo can be tricky. As soon as you unhook the elastic the metal rings on the elastic can scrape your guitar neck. Now I've scratched my tailor when I first tried to escape on it and I've also decided to order another one for my Martin backpacker. You wonder why there's two ways it can scratch your guitar because I scratch to separate guitars.\n\nAs a side note I've used the old walnut trick to get rid of the scratches. If you do not know this trick be sure to look it up.\n\nAlso another side note to take this cable off properly I would push to keep up against the strings so that when you touch the elastic it does not scratch your guitar neck. I have to say I'm shocked that no one else has had this problem that I've had but I felt that you needed to be warrant.\n\nNow that all that is out of the way. I really love this capo even if it only lasts a year or two it holds on tightly to my guitar strap. And also went on the guitar body the capo takes up little to no room allowing you full use around the capo. I hope this helped and heed my warning."

Instead they have a twangy brittle tone with a noticeable pick sound. On acoustic with nylon and also with steel strings they are twangier and more brittle sounding than Clayton Acetal picks, which are about the hardest picks I like to use.\n\nDunlops have that little divot on the top that you see in the pictures. That looks like a sprue site for injection molding. These have the worst I've seen, with more roughness and irregularity than the relatively tame ones on Ultex picks.\n\nSo I've put these on top of my dresser and will try to find a use for them.

Well, I thought maybe I need to wait for them to settle in, but time really did not help with it. The strings lack a lot of sustain and volume, especially on the bass. Treble is... eh, it's okay at best.\n\nOverall, a huge disappointment, especially for the price. About the only good thing I can say about them is... umm... I guess they bend fairly easily?

Ordered this because it was a kit and on price point alone.  For the price paid, this has given me a lifelong hobby and a way to connect with my kids. Huge value.\n\nThe bag is pretty useless. It's thin and crinkly with no protective qualities, really. I suppose it would protect from sunlight and dust.  The cd and DVD are good, but I have gotten much more use out of youtube tutorials!  However, having the chords there in the book are nice, and does provide some basic musical notation info.\n\nThe instrument is obviously a \"starter\" uke. It's light and the finish isn't beautiful, but it doesn't look like a toy, either. The matte finish does attract fingerprints and is very plain. I bought some rub on transfers to personalize and decorate, which made me happier.  The strings do have to be tuned frequently, but I expected that from the reviews. After three weeks of daily playing they tune easier and stay tuned longer but still need tuning before each session. I bought  the Hola! Electronic tuner and just leave it clipped on. Works beautifully.  I think the sound is pretty and it seems reasonably well made for the price. I'm sure I will trade up in a year or two, but this is a great starter.\n\nI would recommend this for anyone wanting to give ukulele a whirl. It's a fast learning curve, and super fun!"

It's a little bit tight around my head but my head is larger than average.  I haven't stretched it out too much because I didn't want it to get too loose on me, but so far, it's been holding its shape (and still a bit tight on me).\n\nI mostly use this to sing backup while drumming.

Once the uke got tuned which takes about 2-3 days with the string stretch, it plays well and sounds good.\nIt's fit and finish isn't the best, and the sound is marginal, but overall it's a real decent value. Later when I have achieved more experience and talent, I can upgrade. I have paid so little for this setup, that it is easy for me to pass it along to someone else that wants to learn the Uke and there is no real financial loss.\nHint-Get the Snark SN-6 Ukulele Tuner. It is small and accurate, and makes Tuning a breeze.. which you will be doing a lot of the first few days. If it don't sound right to me, I just check it with the Snark. KEEP THIS FOR THE NEXT UPGRADE\n\nYou can put better sounding strings on this unit and it sounds better. But for learning the Uke.. it really can't be beat. I'd give it 5 stars if it were a better quality Uke... Plus it's a unit that can go on the road in a pack on a motorcycle, to the college dorm, and there is no worries your risking damage to an expensive unit. It's a perfect learning instrument. Then you can do with it what you want once your ready to upgrade... give it to a niece or nephew, grand child... send it off to college, you name it.. it will always be worth what you paid for it....\nI have no negitives.. it is what it is... designed to be a starter Ukulele, and it preforms that task with class... I am not afraid to show or let pro's play it and look at it.. they are also impressed with its quality at the cost. I used lemon oil on it and hand rubbed it out to a dull luster, and put better strings on it.. so with that.. it is impressive for the cost.\nThere are better Uke's on the market... those are for pro's.

They've always had the best tone, according to my own ears/tastes, and they've always lasted far longer than other strings. When I lived in FL, this was especially important as between the sweat from my hands and the humidity that crushes human beings on daily basis, normal strings would corrode, even rust in less than a week, even with me doing my best to keep them dry/clean. Blue Steels would last a couple of weeks if we weren't practicing regular, and about a week if we were prepping for a gig. In all those years, I've had maybe two E strings break on me, and if I remember correctly, that was waaaay back when I used Floyd Rose tremolo bridges.\n\nOrdered my first new pair of strings since I had John Bolin do a fantastic setup/custom tuning on my favorite Jackson. The first four strings went on without a hitch, but the B string just snapped in half with barely any tension on it. It surprised me and my roommate, who was changing his strings as well (his weren't BS's, he tried the Drop-C DDT's). I shrugged and said, meh, whatever, it happens sometimes. I popped on another B from a brand new set of DR's that were the same size as my BS's, then began to tune again.\n\nWith barely any tension on the high E, it too snapped. It isn't like I've never changed strings (again, almost twenty years of doing it very regularly), so I know it wasn't my fault. I MIGHT have decided I'd done something wrong when the first string broke (in fact, I did, I've broken strings before). But when the second one did the same thing, again, with barely any tension, I got pretty angry.\n\nSince I was right in the middle of changing out strings on three different guitars, I wasn't in the mood to remove all the BS strings and replace with those from the DR set. So now I've got a 4-string DR set, and a 4-2 BS-DR mix on the Jackson.\n\nOverall, I'm very disappointed. I'm extremely forgiving of a product having a defect once in a while, and guitar strings can be delicate creatures. But two strings from the same package with barely any tension seems like a QC issue. I'll have to think very hard about whether or not I'll buy BS strings in the future, as this has soured me for a while, not to mention I'm simply in love with my DR DDT strings."

Cut to size and fasten down. An old plastic library card or wifeys credit card will work as well. You can cut these to size a lot easier then an old truss rod cover. An FYI from Fingers That Sing!!"

I realize that with a design like this it's inevitable, but if it was just a bit wider it would be a lot better. Reason being, if you have three standard scale guitars in this, and one of them has a headstock that angles back/away from the fretboard, that headstock is going to bonk into any other guitars that you put in this stand. The guitars also need to be almost completely upright when sitting in them to avoid hitting each other, which makes it a bit perilous, especially if someone were to accidentally bump into it.\n\nIf you put an Acoustic in this stand, the guitars next to it need to be small (and electric), because the acoustic body will smack the guitars adjacent to it as well. It does fit three six string Ibanez guitars just fine, but with a seven in there I have to constantly keep an eye on things when I put the guitars away so that the headstocks don't \"joust\" with each other. I decided against putting even a small chambered nylon string in this stand, and am using it with three of my straightest-headstocked guitars. It works, but honestly I wouldn't buy this again. It's fine for my small home studio where I can always have the same three guitars in it, but for a gigging musician this would be an accident waiting to happen."

Had high hopes for it but even looking at the picture I thought \"I wonder how they get the strings to not bind up inside?\". The answer? They didn't. First string I went to grab was the low E. I followed the instructions and held the rest of the strings in place while pulling and it got stuck. Pulled as hard as I could without risking damage to the string and it would only come out about 6 inches...and then it wouldn't go back in. I tried another string, same thing. I now had 2 low E strings sticking out 6 inches from the box. I had no choice but to open the box up all the way, take apart the plastic spools inside, unwind ALL of the low E strings, and then try to wrap them back up again. The result? I now have 25 brand new low E strings with finger prints all over them. Thought my problems were over once I finished with the 3 wound strings. Nope. Sure enough went to grab a G and it got stuck. Took some serious coaxing to get it out. I would rather pay the extra money for 25 individual sets of these strings than ever get this bulk box again. They didn't even wrap each bundle of strings in protective sleeves either so by the time I use the last few sets they will probably be corroded and useless. Especially the low E's thanks to my prints. Basically what I'm saying is unless you are a guitar repair tech and plan on changing 25 sets of strings in one week do NOT buy this. Waste of money."

I bought this kit to put on a Fender Starcaster I just purchased and besides the knobs and trem cap nothing else even comes close to fitting. The poles on the pickups are much closer together than the holes in the covers, the toggle switch is cut much wider than the switch it came with so it falls right off, and the back plate is way smaller than the one that comes with the guitar. I just think it's really stupid the company makes an entry level strat that cannot be upgraded with simple parts. Guess that's what happens when you buy an outsourced guitar. From the sound of a few other reviews these also do not fit Squier guitars either. Even if everything did fit the parts just look like something you would get out of a cheap model car kit. You can see the notch where each part was cut from the mold. Not trying to be overly critical but I've seen higher quality molded plastic on mcdonalds toys.

Rather than just giftwrapping the box, I took the uke out, tuned it, retuned it, stretched the strings, retuned it.  After 2 days, it would hold tune for about 3 minutes of playing (junk strings are probably to blame).  I did all this because my neice would be a beginner and therefore be easily frustrated by an instrument that would not hold tune.  Next I went to a \"learn to play\" site on the net and found C Am F G7 chord diagrams and started to attempt to play.  The strings were so high off the fretboard that any note fingered above the 3rd fret would pull the string out of tune.  The easy chords were difficult because the high strings got in the way of my fingers so that I could not finger a chord cleanly.\n\nWith the intonation and tuning problems, I was not willing to give this instrument to my neice, so next I went to a local music store to see if a set of strings and some shaving of the saddle (the white peice on the bridge that the strings rest on) would make it playable.  In order to gain a frame of reference, I picked up a $78 uke and strummed my newly learned chords.  It sounded and played great!  I told the music store guy that I wanted this uke to play like the $78 one.  He said the the cost would equal the original cost and still might not produce a good instrument.  Then he showed me a $40 instrument, an entry level uke from  Kala or Lanakai.  It played like the more expensive one, but didn't have the pretty binding, etc.  I loved it and bought it.  When I got home I called for an RMA and will send the much inferior Firebrand uke with all the books and cd's back to the seller.  The sellers were nice and seemed concerned about selling an unplayable instrument.  It's too close to Christmas to waste time on this one.  Hope this helps you out."

When you then further consider the portability, functionality and performance, they are fully worth their premium price tag. I was initially sceptical about the high price, having bought them after all my others, and for more money, but I now think they may well have been my best-value purchase of the lot. I certainly use them more than all the others for convenience including outside jobs with potentially suspect weather (I got the matching outdoor speaker covers and so they can play on their stands outdoors in light rain). I remember at an outdoor gig once, the wind blew my projector screen unto my K10 speaker and stand, so that the K10 fell about 7ft to the hard asphalt ground. It suffered a small dent on the front grill (was in the cover), but did not skip a beat and kept right on playing through the incident, and have continued on with no problems ever since\n\nAll in all, a really fine powered pro speaker. You can get many alternatives for much less, but I think this is really outstanding value for money"

All of those WWs use a 3&3 sort of fingering system, three fingers of each hand to give a basic scale. The Xaphoon adds the left hand pinkie finger into the mix. (That left hand pinkie has always been an \"extra\": G#/Ab. Now it's G!!?) This makes all of the patterns you've learned on your woodwinds over the years quite different. If would be no problem to learn a new system (and I'm still debating whether I should return this or not!) but this instrument is NOT an extension of the saxophone despite it's name. You really can NOT practice it instead of the sax as you would be practicing very different fingerings. At best, you could give your embouchure a little more time (this is quite close to some tenor/bari mouthpieces that I have played) but after nearly 50 years of playing the saxophone, I've just about got the embouchure down already. I wanted time to play licks, old tunes, scale patterns. This instrument requires a complete rethinking of these things. Heck, even playing by ear is tough because my fingers want to move the way I'm used to. A nice instrument for what it is... but it IS a NEW instrument, not one that will aid in learning your saxophone."

They stick out too far and on any guitar with a strap button on the back it jabs you in the stomach or below!\n2- Problems engaging. I would push them into the receiver and they pop back out. It wasn't until I forced them in while pushing the button that they went in a stayed in. Schallers click in and you know they are ready to go.\n3- Cheap. They just feel cheap. Thin metal is used in comparison to the Schallers; which have a very heavy and solid feel to them.\nFor a few bucks more I'll stick with Schaller's.

I had used this for about 2-3 years and felt like I was more than an amateur having this accessory assist with my video recording quality.\n\nPros:\nThe nylon on the filter is double-wide, meaning that each side has a layer of the filter. The space between the nylon is the same as that of the thickness of the ring (about an inch).\nThe neck itself felt like really proper material. Nothing was going to break in half or detach from the filter or the metal plate.\n\nCons:\nThe base of the filter that screws onto the desk/pole/etc. didn't feel like it held too firmly. The round plastic it pushes in has a bit of grooves, but wasn't textured in a way that made me confident it wouldn't slide down.\nThe neck didn't hold its shape as firmly as I had hoped. Bending it too much would have it fight back and not keep as tight of a curve as I needed. This lead to some strange positions to get it in front of my microphone."

Please take note, though, that doesn't mean that it is going to sound great... just that you'll have that odd and annoying honky peak standing out in the mix over everything else.  If you like being the sound engineer that doesn't want to mess with proper mic selection and bother with equalization to create a good mix, maybe the SM57/SM58 actually are the mics for you.

        "reviewText": "I've been reading a lot of very positive reviews for these headphones, so I bought a pair to add to my collection.  I'm a huge fan of AKG microphones, so I've been excited to hear what they're doing with their headphones.  As it turns out, they're good, but not great.\n\nHigh frequencies are a little too loud and more harsh than I'd expect for a set of headphones in this class.  This really causes many of the artifacts caused by MP3 encoding to be over-emphasized.  Instead of being smooth and silky they are a bit cutting and shimmery.  If I was to listen to these at anything over a moderate volume level for long my ears would fatigue rather quickly.  That boost does occasionally help certain types of music, though.  For example, as I'm writing this I'm listening to Lindsey Stirling's \"Elements\" and the high frequency boost makes it easier to hear some of what one of the synth parts is doing compared to other headphones.  But on other tracks it is distracting and unpleasant.  Demi Lovato's voice, for example, is a little grating on these headphones while perfectly fine on others.\n\nThe low end is a bit of a mixed bag.  There seems to be a bit of a boost right around 100 Hz but everything below that is definitely quieter than they ought to be.  The 100-Hz boost is probably why some feel like they have more bass they really do.  But below that they are definitely a little thin and lacking.  They are capable of producing really low frequencies, but they just aren't very loud when doing so.\n\nThe mid-range is also a bit weak.  Vocals seem more distant than they should, especially in comparison to the sibilants which are in your face (again, this is why it is hard for me to listen to Demi Lovato).  There is also a little bit of unwanted honkiness between 1kHz and 1.5kHz as well.  Not bad, but they definitely aren't producing a flat response through the mids.\n\nCompared to my other headphones these are a lot quieter than other models.  I have to turn up the volume nearly all the way on my MP3 player to get sufficient volume.  My other headphones play at comfortable volumes with the player's volume control at half of what is required for the K240s.\n\nIn comparison to the Sony MDR-V6 or MDR-7506 these aren't nearly as good.  At least not if you're talking about accurate reproduction of sound.  The Sonys are much flatter (as in, more accurate, not dull), which means they are both easier and more enjoyable to listen to.\n\nRelative to the Grado SR80e, the Grados definitely have a huge edge over the AKGs.  The SR80e model doesn't have the same aural deficiencies.  But they do rest directly on your ears, which some people may not like.\n\nThey do blow away any <$150 Sennheisers though.  I still haven't figured out why anyone likes the modestly priced Sennheiser headphones.  They all sound awful.\n\nAll in all, these probably are better than any pair of headphones that most people will ever listen to.  But for the money you can do better.  I'd take them over pretty much anything less than $50 for sure, but for just a couple bucks more you can get the amazing MDR-V6 if you are okay with closed backs, or Grado SR80e if you prefer something more open."

I missed Amazon's return window by 2 days, so I would apparently eat the shipping. I've emailed Ultimate Support. If they replace it under warranty, I'll probably just give it away, as I can't stand using it regardless of the defective height cam. I've ordered a third K&M Memphis Pro instead. Further update: Amazon came through promptly authorizing a return after emailing them as well. Ultimate Support customer support also responded very quickly with a suggestion to check that the lever pin was seated evenly (it was), and if not to send them a picture and a copy of my receipt- they would take care of it. It was very reassuring to hear from them so quickly; I emailed K&M about a defective stand a few months back and never heard back from them.\n\nOut of the box, I really like the simple design, easy opening and adjustment, and how compact it folds up. In use, though I find this much more flimsy than two others that I currently have. Every joint has more flex than I'd like. The other two I own have automatic gripping or \"locking\" mechanisms, which I believe are not necessary, given the angle at which the instrument rests (the force required to dislodge any of my instruments from the stand would certainly tip the whole stand over). This one just has an optional rubber strap which cleverly has a tab to hold it out of the way when not in use. I like the design, but for my basses the shape of the yoke doesn't work so well- it holds them fine, the problem is removing them the neck is sort of wedged onto the vee shape of the yoke, so lifting the bass lifts the yoke up too and you kind of have to jerk it free. The height locking cam, while a super simple and clever design doesn't hold very securely. But the joint flexes so much when extended fully to accommodate my 5 string Jazz basses that when I set the bass down, the weight isn't pushing directly down on the lower portion, so it doesn't appear to slip. But the stand is brand new, and I imagine the cam will only get weaker, as it is plastic, and it latches against the metal tube. I'm not sure this is by design or if mine is outside manufacturing tolerances. This and the flimsiness may cause this one to be sent back. I should note, it doesn't appear the flex in all the joints weakens its stability much. In fact it could potentially make it more resistant to tipping. But to me it suggests either poor quality control, poor materials, poor design or corners cut. Edit: given my defective height adjustment cam, much of the flex I noticed could have been a result of that particular defect in mine. Overall, the materials and construction seem well thought out.\n\nI've been on a hanging stand buying spree of sorts lately.

I loved the first K&M, but the second had critical defects out of the box. The Hercules is very good, but is much bulkier than the K&M and Ultimate when folded (not including the non-folding yoke on the Hercules, I'm aware they sell one with that- in this case it is the girth and length of which I speak).\n\nIf it weren't for the flimsiness of this compared to the others (Edit: which could be simply due to a faulty height adjustment latch lever), I'd say it is very competitive with the other two- especially considering the price. The K&M is the lightest, most compact when folded, and the most enjoyable to use - however it is somewhat fragile (be careful not to open it too forcefully, or the height stop in the top tube will snap off). This one, the Ultimate GS100 is the second lightest, and almost as small folded as the K&M. I'd really like the way the legs fold on the Ultimate, if the joints didn't flex so much in use. The hanging yoke of the K&M is also my favorite, as the arms rotate inwards with weight applied, basically automatically adjusting for your neck width. For some necks, the Ultimate GS100 yoke may work better than it does for mine. Again, I think a simple yoke is all that is needed for most instruments on this type of stand. The number of moving pieces on the K&M appears much fewer than the Hercules yoke, and the arms of the K&M seem more durable too. The Hercules stand's frame seems the most stout with the least flex, and for mostly stationary use, it might be my favorite of these three. For packing in and out at rehearsal or the gig, the K&M is the winner for me, as it fits the front pocket of my bass gig bags (well 3/4 of the way at least).\n\nBottom line on this one? Others have had great success with it, but having tried the other two, I can't say I'd recommend it over them. But if saving $10 or so is important, and you don't mind a little flex, or plan to use it with lighter instruments (my heaviest is just shy of 11lbs), this might not be that bad of a choice. It does fold up very nicely- and folds, unfolds very easily."

        "reviewText": "Update: The right angle switched end started developing crackling issues and is now intermittently cutting out. I've had it just over a month, so Amazon won't help me. Despite the lifetime warranty, Amazon has only offered to let me pay shipping and to give me a partial refund. Despite being an \"authorized retailer\" for Planet Waves, AMAZON DOES NOT OFFER EXCHANGE UNDER THE PLANET WAVES WARRANTY beyond the standard Amazon 30 day return policy. Amazon support referred me to the manufacturer. I've emailed Planet Waves, but the instructions for the warranty are to return it to a dealer for exchange. I don't have a dealer within 100 miles of my home, so unless the manufacturer comes through, this one is quickly becoming unusable and it looks like it might cost me to resolve it.\n\nI frequently switch instruments and this makes it easy to do quietly. I've used cables with the G&H quiet plug (which also works well), but the switched connector on this has an advantage over the G&H- you can use it as a mute and tune with a head stock tuner without unplugging your instrument. The cable itself is a bit stiffer than I'm used to, which makes coiling for storage very easy, but it can quickly become a twisted mess on stage if you more length than you really need. The little elastic cord keeper strap works better than I could ever have imagined. I've never given the sound of a cable a thought, being a bass player who doesn't use much for effects and who plays mostly passive instruments. But using this with my Genz Benz Shuttlemax 9.2 and fEARful 15/6/1 cab, I really notice a pronounced difference in clarity and dynamics. The sound is much more alive with this over any of the other cables I have from a variety of manufacturers (Hosa, Proco, Whirlwind, etc). I've never had to warranty exchange a PW cable, but others tout the easy swap at any PW dealer as a great reason to buy them. I like knowing that. ** EDIT: AS STATED ABOVE, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EXCHANGE IT THROUGH AMAZON BEYOND 30 DAYS **"

I have 3 guitars and I typically use the Martin Marquis Custom M1400 Silk & Steel 0.115  0.047 strings, which are absolutely amazing, on my steel string acoustics.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Martin-M1400-Marquis-Silk-Steel-Acoustic-Strings/dp/B0002GZQEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Martin M1400 Marquis Silk & Steel Acoustic Strings</a>. I saw these Martin Acoustic M140 80/20 Bronze (light .012/.054) strings as an add on item here on Amazon for $4.00 which is a phenomenal deal and decided to give them a try. They have great reviews and these same strings cost around $8-$12 at a local shop. These strings are also made by Martin, but they are definitely not my favorite. Please keep in mind the quality of the strings is top notch and this review comes down to personal preference and opinion as far as feel and tone, which is subjective. While I gave these strings 2 stars for perfect quality and packaging, I will never buy them again due to their feel and sound. When I put these strings on my Gibson Epiphone, they looked beautiful. If your guitar has a natural finish, these bronze/gold strings will compliment it nicely. Only the lowest 4 strings are gold, the highest/thinnest two are silver. These strings are the ones for you if you prefer a sharp harsh twangy attack without much ring. They sound flat, tinny, and lifeless to me. And its not just me  my husband who knows absolutely nothing about guitars or strings came home to me playing on these new strings and said whats wrong with your guitar?. I thought maybe they just needed breaking in and continued to play with them for a few days, but there was no change in the sound or feel. Playing on them made me NOT want to play guitar, which I typically love. I threw them out after about a week. Sound aside, I also could not stand the feel of them. They feel rough and clunky compared to my aforementioned favorite Martin strings which are silky smooth, easy on the fingers, and great for sliding around the fret board. I could have gotten on board with these strings if they were rough on the fingers yet sounded amazing, unfortunately, that was not the case."

I should have realized there would be a problem with it because Hodge was advertising it as a swab that can be used to swab out the instrument without taking the neck off. In order to achieve this the silk material is too small. It is superb for just the neck but for the rest of the instrument it is totally inadequate, I am now looking for a \"beefier\" swab that I can use for the main body of the instrument. The plastic coated weight is very nice by the way. I will keep it for just swabbing the neck which it does very nicely."

I didn't give this 5 star because the Lap Dawg needs to be a little longer then it is! It has the right fit for normal size hands, but the length, in my opinion could have been a 1/2 inch longer so when placed on a six string Lap it fits across all six strings! It smoothly goes down the strings forward and back, but when moving up and down changing notes it has a tendency of catching on the first string! Just from my personal observation the Dawg fits my hand well, with the one exception noted! I think longer would be better!"

        "reviewText": "I have been using QSC K10s for close to a couple of years now. I am a solo performer, playing a variety of styles from acoustic singer-songwriter stuff to loop-driven electro-rock. I typically play bars and have probably used these for nearly 100 gigs at this point.\n\n3 K10s along with an&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Allen-Heath-ZED-10FX-Four-Mono-Mic-Lines-with-2-Active-D-I-3-Stereo-Line-Inputs-and-Onboard-Effects/dp/B003T77ZJU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Allen & Heath ZED-10FX Four Mono Mic/Lines with 2 Active D.I., 3 Stereo Line Inputs and Onboard Effects</a>&nbsp;mixer make up my whole system, using two as mains and one as a monitor. My previous system was a powered Mackie box and passive 12\" speakers by Community and Yamaha.\n\nI have thus far been thrilled with the significant sound improvement I have experienced. The volume and clarity that these 10\" speakers produce is truly impressive. To give you an idea, I generally play rooms that are one to two thousand square feet in size and rarely turn my mains up much past 50%. At 60-75% levels (with mixer meters peaking around the zero mark) the music will cut through even the rowdiest bar noise.\n\nOne thing that's great about this 10\" model is the throw. With a super-wide 90 degree dispersion angle, sound fills out the space up close within a few feet, depending on placement (I prefer getting them up as high as possible on stands and using the clever 7.5 degree tilt function). The dispersion angle is also matched between the woofer and tweeter so you're never hearing just one or the other. 90 degrees is ideal for tight performance areas where you want people right in front of you to hear everything.\n\nThe trade-off here is that levels decrease quickly as you step back from the speakers. You can hear a significant difference as you get more than twenty or thirty feet away. While that could be seen as a negative especially for public address applications, I find it to be a win-win.  It essentially creates a \"full sound\" zone around the stage for the audience. I personally prefer creating a live music environment where people can hear a loud, full spectrum mix if they like but not have it forced on them wherever they are in the room. If your needs call for a speaker with more reach, the K12s (I've used them) throw a lot further and sound awesome as well.\n\nSpeaking of sound quality, I will say that while I think the K10 kicks the competition's a** throughout the EQ, it is especially spectacular in the mids and highs. Just playing an iPod through them, you will hear separated parts of the music in this range that you never did before. As far as your perfomances go, vocals and guitars will sparkle in a way you probably haven't heard out of a small cabinet.\n\nI don't want to downplay the bass response on these though. It is huge and far more than you would expect out of these little guys. The frequency coverage is absolutely there and can even be boosted if you utilize the DEEP switch. What you will NOT hear in the lower registers however is a ton of attack. They are more suited to adequately express a jazzy upright bass than they are to throw down the punch you want to hear from electronica or hip-hop (unless we're talking smaller spaces, they'll ROCK a house party DJs). Impressive but you'll find no magic here, that's why they make the Ksub.\n\nProspective buyers should also know that the 1 KW amp in these is Class D. That's not equivalent to 1000 watts in Class A for example. It's more than sufficient though and Class D amps are great for their light weight and power efficiency. I plug mine into a surge protector that powers a bunch of other devices simultaneously and have never had an issue.\n\nSignal routing is wildly flexible with the fantastic panel on the back. You can do whatever you want with these including play a small gig with one speaker alone. Just plug a mic, an instrument, and an iPod directly in.\n\nErgonomics are well done too. Knobs and switches are not fancy but easy to operate. There's also super sturdy, comfy handles on the top and on one side. Carrying two at once is easy (32 lbs. each) and saves you a trip back to the car.\n\nThe build quality is solid. I've always been careful with them but not used cases or bags and the only damage thus far has been cosmetic. The sides will scuff up pretty easily so use the duffels if thats important to you.\n\nI have not observed any malfunction up to this point other than some buzzing from the monitor once when it got rained on. After drying out, it didn't happen again. QSC has also put some serious limiting circuitry into these as well to protect themselves from blowing. I have more than once pushed my monitor too hard and reached this threshold. The signal simply cuts out when the the speaker cone experiences too much travel. Once you readjust the levels, you're back in business with no issue.\n\nI can't think of much to gripe about, the whole K series was very well thought out. I would love to incorporate a Ksub at some point as the crossover function is built into the entire line. These speakers aren't cheap at $700 a piece but you'll be paying for quality and design that cannot be found elsewhere."

I appreciate any reduction in weight when carrying gear to gigs.\n\nThe stand seems well built and sturdy enough as one would expect from Ultimate. I wouldn't worry about a guitar sliding off of it unless it was really bumped into. However, if you've got either a strap on your guitar or a cable plugged into it, one of these two will inevitably get caught up in the support arms and knock the whole stand over when you pick the instrument back up. I tried this over and over with acoustic and electric and the thing fell over because of this more often than not. The support arms are covered in grippy rubber and they do not \"clip\" into place. Therefore they sort of wander and are just begging to get caught on something. This doesn't cut it in a performance setting where you need to be able to pick up and set down your guitars quickly.\n\nIf you just need something with an understated look for home use (where you're not using a strap or plugging in), this might be a great pick. I'm just surprised that anyone would find it adequate for gigs. Mine's going back in exchange for another GS-100 which I've previously had and would definitely recommend for live use."

Me too. So i bought this little mama from Amazon, 'cuz it was the lowest price,for the best name brand. See, i plays in a 6-piece wedding band, i plays drums and sometimes we play small clubs and dirty dives. I needs bass drum BOOM and i get it with the Nady DM70. just plug an XLR cable(not included)into the mic and run it to your board,let the sound guy(or in this case the keys player)EQ and level it,and man,you got bottom. Great little mic, great little price.comes w/plastic box and includes folding mic clip. Me Likey."

The bass in the AKG K240 drops off severely below 50 Hz and is nearly inaudible at 30 Hz even though the product description claims 15 Hz.  Any attempt to boost the bass will result in fluttering sounds of driver excursion. I personally prefer to leave my music source flat and I don't like using bass boost, but I want to hear natural sounding clear and sufficiently loud bass.\n\nHere's a spectral plot analysis of the acoustic music video \"It's Time\" from \"Imagine Dragons\". http://bit.ly/1nbufm8\n\nEven though it's acoustic music (they don't even use true bass instruments), there's a lot of music between 30 and 70 Hz.  So contrary to the opinions of music elitists who frown at \"bassheads\" and the bass heavy products, we really do need good bass reproduction for all sorts of music.  What the elitists who give this product a high rating call \"flat\" or \"neutral\" is misleading.  Flat should mean the frequency response is flat throughout the music frequency spectrum.\n\nAll that said, I will say that I like the build quality and the detachable cable."

The weakness of the OC-2 is that you can't really add the extra low octave because it farts out and does not track in the lower registers on bass. With the OC-3, I thought that perhaps Boss had solved this problem. I found a used one that ended costing me 15 dollars with some other trades. With the bass, the OC-3 is muddier and harder to hear compared to the OC-2. I used it mostly on the poly setting. The lower notes track, but they all sound kind out of tune. The controls are just not that intuituive also. I am glad I kept my OC-2 because I will be going back to it as soon as possible.

However, my first pair went dead on me after a year so I ordered another pair thinking that maybe that was an aberration or something.  Low and behold, less than three months later the second pair left speaker went out too.  I have to find another studio grade headphone other than these.  Very unfortunate in terms of quality because I am a long time Vic Firth customer with sticks, DVD's, etc  UPDATE:  I emailed Vic Firth and they responded the next morning saying that they will send me a new pair!  Very good service and responsiveness!\n\nUpdate:  12-1-17:  Vic Firth actually sent me a second (free for replacement) pair of these headphones because the first ones they sent me went dead on the left side AGAIN after just about 5 months.  I NOW HAVE FOUR PAIRS OF THESE HEADPHONES AND ALL OF THEM WENT DEAD ON THE LEFT EAR WITHIN A FEW MONTHS!  BEWARE!  I noticed many other reviewers with the same problem too!  I bought a pair of KAT headphones for drumming about a year ago and now they're starting to sputter!  They do isolate and sound very good though."

They used to sound a lot better and last a lot longer, but they're the only show in town so I keep buying them.\nI double a number of instruments and need to be able to just pick up a horn and play without having to wet the reed first. The new Plasticover Ricos don't sound nearly as good as they used to in the old days, and the plastic flakes off after a while. Unfortunately, nobody else offers plastic coated reeds anymore. In 1967, I bought a large quantity of Rico Plasticovers from a music store that went out of business. I still had some of those left until a couple of years ago. When I finally had to break down and buy some new ones, I was appalled by the drop in quality. It's shocking when you can directly compare new Ricos with New Old Stock Ricos. I guess this must be some more of that \"New Normal\" I keep hearing about."

Kaiser Capos work well and I enjoy using them.\n\nIf you are looking for other options, check out the Paige, G7 and Shubb.  The benefit of the Kaiser is that it clips on to the headstock when not in use and it has a spring that automatically clips on.\n\nShubbs are also well regarded.  They clip on when you lock them.\n\nOne of the G7 is really neat as it clips on very easily.  I really like it, but it is expensive.  The Nashville version seems to be more like the Kaiser.\n\nThe Paige a very different design and I really like it.  I recommend that you consider that option as you can leave it on the guitar and slide it onto the headstock when not in use.  Some folks don't like them with guitar stands that hang the guitar by the neck, but I find you just have to be careful in how you place the guitar in the stand."

Like the Squier (but not as bad), it gets a little buzzy on the top strings. I suspect it might need to be adjusted, but I don't have a clue as to how to go about it.\n\nIt's also a good choice for women. I'm a small woman, and I really like that the neck is smaller.

I have another similar floor stand that holds my guitar straight upright, which is what I expected here. Due to the angle, I couldn't place the stand as close to the wall as I wanted because the headstock would crash into it.

In the same way as all we, people, have the same hands, legs and heads but have different nature and voices, the guitars, even of the same model of the same manufacturer may differ wildly.\n\nThe Classical guitar has to be made of wood. And wood, even of the same age and tree has much of personality and much of \"specifics in sound.\n\nIf you consider this guitar you are shopping in the lowest end for cheap instrument. Well do not do it! Because I doubt you will learn it ever.\n\nFirst of all buy the real Spanish guitar. I mean Spanish made in Span not the \"Spanish\" made in China or anywhere else. Spanish guitars, even the cheapest made toward sound, not toward look. Do not buy guitar with laminated top, it will sound as a toilet sitting and you never will be able to get decent sound out of it. The quality of sound is very important while playing classical guitar and you produce the sound with your hands. It is crucially important to learn to produce right sound by positioning fingers and nails properly: you will never learn it with cheap, not authentic guitar, because it will sound the same whatever you will try! It is like a car that make only left turn. Then you will try to play the real guitar not the bogus one , you will find youself incapable to make it sound as other players do.\n\nDo not try to choose guitar yourself because you can't produce any reasonable judgment until you will learn how to make it sound properly, you must take someone who actually knows how to play classical guitar. You have to get  a decent instrument because you MUST fall in love with the sound of one, otherwise it is pointless: you play guitar because it fascinates you esthetically. I doubt that toilet sitting sound out of shipping box that pretends to produce music will fascinate you!\n\nOnce again, Spanish guitar improves with an age but not one with the laminated top. If you in budget, do not trash you money with cheap Chinese garbage but save more instead and by the real thing.\n\nHere we are, these are my recommendations for those who really seek to learn to play classical/Spanish guitar:\n\n1. Do not buy guitar online, buy it in the local Guitar Center for example! Listen to the actual instrument. If you like the sound take it!\n\n2. Do not buy guitar with laminated top, they are guitar only by appearance.\n\n3. Buy Spanish guitar from Spanish manufacturer, they start as low as $250, roughly."

Instead, these are really pathetic.  They resemble a gooseneck in appearance only.  They will not hold any shape more extreme than a useless 5 degree bend.  I find it hard to believe a human being actually was involved in quality control of this product.  Utterly worthless for the intended purpose, they will either be returned or thrown away.

I wanted that Gibson look without the insane Gibson price tag, and this is it!\n\nThe guitar came packaged nicely with plenty of padding, bubble wrap, and all the plastic surfaces have thin protective plastic that has to be pealed off fresh out of the factory. Not a single scuff or ding on the body, it truly looks gorgeous and I'm going to try my damnedest to keep it that way!\n\nThis will be replacing my worn out Fender Strat while I wait for replacement parts for it. Compared to the Fender, this Epiphone has a slightly wider fret board that took me a little time to get used to, but in the long run I believe this will be a welcome change for me and my big hands.\nThis guitar sounds good! Out of the box it comes with strings already installed and it's even nearly in tune. It appears to be already adjusted for intonation or at least close to it. Even though the included strings sound alright, I will probably be changing them soon to Ernie Balls because they feel a bit rough on the fingers and I prefer the slick feeling of regular slinkys.\n\nMy only complaint with this guitar is that my \"Killpot\" feature doesn't appear to be working. This SG Special is suppose to be equipped with a tone knob that pushes in like a button. While you're holding the tone knob down the signal is suppose to be cut to complete silence. However, when I press mine I can feel it click in and out, but absolutely nothing happens. I've pressed it, tapped it, held it down, pumped it, it doesn't do a damn thing! It's a shame because I really liked the idea of cutting the volume without having to roll the volume pot down.\n\nHave you experienced this with your Epiphone as well? I'd love to hear a solution.\nI'll attach some photos of my new SG Special, as well as a comparison to my Fender.\n\nThanks for reading, I'd love to see your comments and helpful votes!"

It's playable, but it's far more work than it should be, and it's difficult to make the notes sound at something approximating equal loudness when some of them want to come out as more of a wheeze than a clear tone. To be fair, the Blues Harp doesn't leak as much as some Chinese harmonicas, such as the Hohner Blues Bands (which leak like screen doors). But other (non-Chinese) harmonicas manage to leak far less - my Seydel Blues Session and Suzuki Promaster leak only slightly, my Lee Oskar doesn't leak at all. Even other German-made Hohners such as the Special 20 leak far less than the Blues Harp.\n\nThere are some other peculiarities, such as the reed plates which somewhat inexplicably overhang the front of the comb. They only protrude about twelve thousandths of an inch, or a bit less than 1/64, but it's certainly enough to feel weird. I can handle that, and it's not a fatal flaw, it's just ... weird.\n\nIn sum, this is a bizarrely designed and indifferently manufactured harp, and very overpriced for the quality it delivers. A disappointing acquisition."

The first cajon I bought was a pearl:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Pearl-Canyon-Cajon-with-Fixed-Snare/dp/B00IMNCEBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pearl Canyon Cajon with Fixed Snare</a>&nbsp;which I picked up at guitar center for my kid, who's a drummer.  It was great and was pretty near $100 at the store.  We did a casual gig with it the same day.  Anyway, exactly the same price on amazon as this Meinl.\n\nAnyway, I figured you pretty much get what you pay for.  Right?  At least that's generally been my experience with musical instruments.  So I typed \"cajon\" in the amazon search and pulled the trigger on this one with it's 4.7 star rating without too much thought.  It arrived, wrapped up nicely with a card that said something like \"free shaker with your amazon review\".  I thought that was cool.  Now I think it's complete BS.  Well it sounded like crap.  So. we loosened the head a little to try to get a little more snap...still horrible.  Didn't even realize how bad it was until I brought the Pearl in and played it to compare.  Not even close.  Not even in the ballpark.  I got on amazon, read some reviews, and tried tightening the snares as suggested.  Still, just awful.\n\nAnd no, I didn't bother trying to put a towel in it, as suggested by some.  You see, I've got this ISSUE.  I've got another cajon that's (currently ) EXACTLY THE SAME PRICE on amazon and sounds a hundred times better.  It's a MUSICAL INSTRUMENT.  The pearl has better bass response and the out-of-the-box fixed snare sounds great for $109.00.  It's cheap, entry level, stuff I'm sure, to anyone who really knows, but again, it's at least an instrument.  Compared to the Pearl, the Meinl literally sounds like a box.  It has the weird ring other reviewers mention, and the snare is horrible.  There is no reason to work a hack on something when there's a better option at the same price point.\n\nI've attached photos of the inside of both the pearl and the Meinl.  The Meinl has the 2 snares running from top to bottom.  They're \"adjustable\", but it doesn't matter.  The pearl with it's fixed snares (look like broom-shaped snare thingies) sounds so much better out of the box that it's just not even funny.  If you don't believe me, order both and send back whichever one sounds awful."

My problem with them is they blacken my fingertips on both hands when I play the guitar.  I can wipe the strings down before I play and after I play but it doesn't make any difference.  And I'm not talking about minor transferance but major blackening of the fingertips.  I have several guitars and use D'Addario strings on the others and don't have this problem so it isn't how I play or my fingertips being rough or something like that.  Interestingly I've used these same strings in the past but didn't have this problem.  The only difference I can think of is the strings I recently put on the guitar were purchased over a year ago.  They were still in their original sealed box and didn't look tarnished when I took them out.  Now I also recently installed some D\"Addario strings that were also purchased a year ago and have not had a problem with them so it's clearly the Martins. My advice would be to go with the D'Addario strings but if you want to go with the Martins try and find fresh stock."

Genuine top grain leather mandolin straps are commonly available for a slightly higher price ($23 to $25 compared to the $20 list price for this strap).\n\nAs far as this strap goes, the maximum length is 51 inches. It can be shortened by 6 inches through the slots on the main part of the strap. The main strap is 2 inches thick and very soft, so it can comfortably carry various instruments with strap buttons (not just a mandolin).\n\nPersonally, for the price, if I was looking for an old-fashioned leather and wood look to my instrument, I would pay a little more for a top grain leather strap."

The old one still works fine, and I plan to put the new one in the \"main\" position under the hi-hat, and the old one attached to a cymbal stand on my right side.  Now I can have an extra pair of sticks on both sides and never worry about fumbling after a dropped stick again!!\n\nUpdate:\nI initially gave this a 5-star review based upon the fact that the old one I had stood up to 20 years of use before it broke. I got the replacement months ago and after using it for a while I had to drop the review down to a 1-star review based upon the fact that the clamp is nowhere near as strong on this one as it was on the earlier version. Just brushing against the sticks in the holder can cause the whole thing to pop off of the stand and go flying.  I will definitely have to order a different stick holder and use this one as a backup or even just toss it.  It isn't worth the price."

That means you would need another short XLR mic cable to extend from the mic to this adapter.\n\nSo just be aware that this may work fine for some and not work at all for others.

But that's not really a fair assessment considering the 57 and 58 were developed at the same time, and except for the 58's acoustic foam lined cage pop screen, the two mics are identical electrically.\n\nThe SM (Studio Microphone) 57 was designed to begin it's life in a recording studio, as a dynamic microphone used to mic the ever increasing volume of rock and roll amplifiers, drum kits, etc. In that capacity, it had no use for the pop screen of it's cousin the SM58, still one of the most sold vocal mics in the world to this day. So the SM57 slimmed down and even though it's still a fine vocal mic, you'll see it used mostly mic'ing instruments, which it excels at.\n\nOne of it's long time and most important roles has been the official podium mic for the White House. A pair of SM57's is always seen on various White House podiums for press conferences and there is even a VIP bundled kit&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Shure-SM57-VIP-Dual-Microphone-Kit/dp/B000CZ0R3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Shure SM57 VIP Dual Microphone Kit</a>&nbsp;you can buy for this exact type of use.\n\nThe SM57 is an extremely rugged mic, built to tough standards and can take lots of road abuse.

And on top of that, it's just a great sounding mic for the price.\n\nThere is a Performer Series&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Shure-Beta-57A-Microphone/dp/B0002BACAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Shure Beta 57A Microphone</a>&nbsp;that looks very similar to the SM57 but the Beta 57 has a different mic capsule and transformer and sounds different. So make sure you try before you buy.\n\nBottom line is the Shure SM57 is one tough road mic that sounds awesome and is not overly priced. A best value for sound companies, home studio recordists and touring musicians."

One of the very first mics we truly fell in love with was the SM58. Introduced by the Shure Brothers Company in 1966, the SM58 quickly rose to become the industry standard in rugged road mics that actually sound good to the ear and are nearly indestructible.\n\nThe mic capsule is of cardiord (heart shaped) design which helps reject sound from either side. There is a 4K bump in it's frequency which helps vocals cut through stage noise. Construction is rugged, frequency response is 50 to 15,000 Hz, and the capsule sits internally on a foam shock mount to help isolate it from handling noise.\n\nWe used to joke about the SM58 in that if you needed a hammer and you couldn't find one, just grab one of these, they are that tough. I've seen some of these on the road that you couldn't believe still worked, but they did and sounded great.\n\nThe cage style pop screen gives the SM58 not only it's distinctive look, one that influenced many other mic brands from the day it was introduced, but it's part of the functionality. Internally lined with a layer of acoustic foam, the cage helps keep vocals pops from getting to the dynamic mic element.

Further, the tension is considerably higher than a normal round wound set of strings of the same gauge so, for those of you with floating tremolos, be prepared to tighten your claw and maybe be prepared to tighten your truss rod as well. These would  probably work well for jazz guitars but I'm more than a bit surprised at the use of word \"Rockers\" in the label.

However, after three weeks of use, one of the draw reeds went way out of tune. I took it apart and found to my dismay that it wasn't caused by an obstruction. It looks like this particular reed was aggressively tuned (you can see the tool marks gouging into the reed). I don't know if this is a normal way of tuning reeds, or not, but unfortunately, the reed is now bent way out of shape at that spot. Maybe I drew too hard, or maybe the reed was weakened at the tuning point and bent further during normal use. At any rate, there doesn't appear to be anything that I can do to fix it.\n\nI've since bought another one, and this one is easier to play than the last and sounds better. Luck of the draw?\n\nAt $1.50, this obviously isn't intended to be a pitch-perfect, high-quality orchestral piece. What you get is a tiny harmonica that you can literally take anywhere and plays a complete scale. The overall quality isn't the absolute best, but it's certainly no worse than any of the other inexpensive Chinese-made harmonicas I've used. The tone seems a little off, and drawing is a little tough. The holes in the comb are closely spaced. I'm still a fairly green harmonica player, but right out of the package I was able to play the first few bars of \"Ode to Joy\" on it without too much difficulty."

        "reviewText": "After all these reviews I expected the Greatest Strings Ever, golden strands of Glory that would last for a year with sparkling tonal perfection!\n\nInstead, I got a decent set of .10's that lasted a whole hour before the D snapped at the neck pickup. I use a PRS with a Wilkinson bridge that rarely breaks strings, and I pre-stretch them gently but completely. Plus I tune down to Eb for vocal and breakage reasons, so I break very few of my normal strings, Slinky .10's. Ergo, a break in one hour from a thick string under minimal tension, tuned down, is unacceptable, especially when these strings cost three times as much as most all other electric strings.\n\nAs for the tone, it's definitely bright and almost too edgy, but nicely zingy all told. Yet one negative I've noticed after about 8 hours' loud playing with a drummer is that these things seem to vibrate more widely than most strings, making them harder to tune. Sounds odd, I know, but when I replaced the D with a Slinky D (replacing singles ain't cheap either at triple the price, please note), I've since noticed that it tunes faster and in a tighter range than the Elixir strings.\n\nSo, I must say I'm summarily unimpressed so far with Elixir electric strings.\n\nWhat's the good of string lasting a long time if it breaks fast?\nEspecially when it costs three times more?\nAnd what's up with the tuning thing?\nAnd why do these cost so much more, anyhow? Is a micro-thin coating of siliconish stuff really worth two bucks extra each string? Not when that string is toast in 50 minutes, zero doubt there.\n\nAnyhow, I've got five Elixirs and one Slinky on my main ax now, so as they age I'll get a good feel for how the Elixirs stay in tune and hold their tone, and I'll report back here in a while. And by the way, that Slinky D sounds almost exactly the same as the Elixirs, tonally. So much for Magic Elixir Tone.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I really do want to love these, as I hate changing strings, but geez guys, how about some quality control?\nIf I'm going to pay triple the price, then is it crazy to expect triple the quality? Or heck, even just a little better...\n\nPS If you look at the D'Addario reviews (I love their acoustic strings), they respond to many of the reviews and questions. I hope that Elixir will do the same here and address my questions.\n\n[Edit: And now, after only six hours' of playing on that guitar, the B string popped at the same place as the D, neck pickup. Once again I ask: what good are strings that \"sound good three times longer\" if they break three times faster?]\n\n[Edit: 10/31/12. Come on! After four more hours, the A string went. I only play that ax one or two sessions a week, and the next time I joked to the drummer, \"Which one will go today?\" He said he's amazed the G is still on, as he plays too and knows the G takes the most tension. An hour later, guess what? Yep. So that's four broken strings in less than 20 hours' play. Seriously?\n\nNot only are these not a good deal for 9 bucks, I'd be bummed if they cost 3 bucks. The only plus I can think of at this point is they sounded good when new, but dang, unless you play totally smooth jazz or some such, I'd stick with Slinkies or D'Addarios. Unless I got a \"bad set\", which seems kinda lame for triple the normal price. In any case, these Elixirs were just not worth the money.]\n\n[Edit, 3/3/13: I called Elixir and told them about the multiple breakage, and they sent me another set. That set has taken a few four hour hard rock sessions with no breaks yet, though the tuning issue remains. But honestly, at this price, there should be no duds at all. These are overpriced and overrated, from my experience with multiple sets.]"

When I looked the face of the guitar was bowing up and the bridge was pulling up and back as if they were trying to pry it off. I released the tension on all the strings as fast as I could and left it. I returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail. The body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now.

I Originally wanted to get mega clamps, but decided on these instead because they don't need a wrench to be adjusted, which I thought might be a good option for just being able to toss some light up quickly.\n\nThese C-Clamps do their job. They stay put on pipes and other mounting surfaces, but their design makes them frustrating in two ways:\n\nFirst, because the clamp Is bent in on itself a lot and it is small, you have to totally unthread the tensioning bolt to get it to slide on to the pipe, then totaly tension it to store it in a smaller space. threading the tensioning bolt in or out all the way takes a fair amount of time. When all the way out, the tensioning bolt also gets in the way of focusing the light where it needs to go. If you are mounting the light on a bigger light it won't be as easy to focus.\n\nSecond, the attach point for the clamp is annoying, the combination of washers, bolts, and wing nut that chauvet picked do not serve my purpose, I ended up getting a different combination of hardware the next time I was at Home Depot.\n\nI would not use these c-clamps for theatrical lights, they work okay for mounting temporary work lights, but they would suck for theater."

The bottom / flat ends of these doohickeys have a small - 3-4mm area of sticky stuff that doesn't adhere very long to the side of your drums, so most of mine are currently on the floor, under my kit.

You can tell the difference in size and weight....the G7th G7 Performance 2 Capo is more expensive, is heavier in weight and in girth.

The Mic appears to be a well designed mic that will go forever (the battery life is great [1AA] too) Great, as well,  its picking up the most sensitive sounds. I also used it with my outdoor drum circle. Listening to the recording, you could close your eyes and you wouldn't know you weren't there in person --- of course the Tascam is pretty high quality, but this is GREAT. Buy it!!!\n\nEDIT - November 16 2016 ---- and this thing is STILL making recordings of live rehearsals that are mind-blowing. I put them on Soundcloud and everyone remarks on how amazing they sound.

No it is not the quality of a P-Bass or other more pro bass but it is great for learning or just playing with. I owned this same bass and sold it a few years back and for its price range it is the best bass I have ever played, so I got another one.\nThe tone is nice and the feel is comfortable. Fret buzzing is minimal and with the few adjustments I made it might even hold its own on a gig. The first thing I did was change the factory strings to some better grade Flat-Wounds and that helped a lot.\nThe Amp that comes with this kit is really cool too. It has a 4 band equalizer for highs, lows, hi-mids, and low mids. I gets to a nice volume for \"bedroom practice\" but I would not blast it for sake of the speaker. Getting BOTH this amp and the bass itself for this price is a bargain.\nThe only reason that I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is still a beginners guitar. This is OK to start learning on but if you want to be a \"Bass Player\" you will want to get something better down the road.\nAll and all this is a solid product and I would recommend it for any beginner."

This was the only stand they had in stock, and I wish I would have gone next door to Guitar Center. It doesn't feel very stable once you set an amp on it because it only has the one post for support in the back, and you have to make sure the amp's weight is distributed equally on either side of the post rather than just centering it. Also, the knob or whatever the contraption is that is supposed to keep the legs in place failed, and it won't even hold up my little Fender Frontman 25 without collapsing.  It's just a bad design in general, and I'm only giving it two stars because it lasted 2 years instead of failing right away, and I DO like the fact that it folds up into a very compact size, but for $30, do yourself a favor and get something a bit sturdier."

I was finally able to install on the cheap Gibson Baldwin using the double sided sticky tape and some extra materials from the hardware store.

I have so many guitars now, I wanted a new one, so I purchased the same thing in January 2017.  What a disappointment!  The thing is not at all like the old one.  I could tell the minute I took it out of the package.  The plastic is cheaper, lighter material, and the clipper end/hinge is made of thin tin now.  The hinge is not as smooth.  The one from just three years ago from Planet Waves was heavier duty all the way around.\n\nPlanet Waves has cheapened their overseas supplier to make a buck.  I will not be buying another of these string winders, and am reluctant to buy further Planet Waves/D'Addario products from here on out."

It has a very nice natural sound that works well to amplify my Kala Archtop Ukulele with pickup. It also amplifies my vocals through the Shure SM58beta mic. BUT it will not do both at the same time, in spite of having two separate inputs. SO, I can't use it as I'd planned, singing and playing the ukulele. It may be possible to link it to a second HOG 30, but I am exploring other options that will allow me use a keyboard and to get some vocal effects too. It is probably my lack of knowledge and not the fault of the product, but I think the advertising should clearly say that mic and instrument won't work at same time, it is one or the other.\n\nIn the meantime, to be fair, this is a fine and portable practice amp. I am learning a lot by listening to my own ukulele playing, working for clean fretting and smooth chord changes. So this product does have some use to me.\n\nUPDATE:  I bought a \"Y\" cable to see if I could plug the mic and the instrument cable into one input to amplify both vocals and ukulele through one input. Does not work. Still gives precedence to one or the other.\nVERY disappointed."

The product in itself is quite good! Finish is good its got good padding on the sides. Two padded straps to protect your keyboard. However it is way bigger for a 61 key keyboard ( i have a fantom x6).\nAlso i don't think it will survive air travel or extensive touring.\nHowever the major pain point for me was the weight - its listed at 8.8 pounds on the amazon website - however it felt more like 15 pounds (heavier than my SKB 4214W) - so i checked the product packaging - it says the net weight as 8 KILOS and gross as 10 kg. So there is definitely an error from amazon's end.\nAs a result i am compelled to return this otherwise good product (though it doesn't compare to flight cases or SKB 4214W like molded plastic cases).\nP.S. - interior has lot of empty space - if you think the padding will protect from impacts due to gravity, - then definitely i think it should be less than 1 meter or so (just a speculation). On the upside you can keep lot of additional items inside along with your keyboard (though i would avoid pointy stuff like keyboard stands etc.)"

        "reviewText": "I am laughing to myself reading some of these reviews - I have been playing for 47 years and survived the Arbiter Fuzz Face, (yes, I had one) which to me sounded a lot like an amp with a blown speaker. Anything the industry has come out with since then has been an improvement.\n\nAs a general rule, I don't really use sound effects these days (mostly because I like the sound of my amp - crazy, huh?) but every now and then I like a little reverb and when practicing it's nice to have some distortion to get a little more sustain at lower volumes. I wasn't expecting much for the price but in this particular case I thought the pedal went very well with the rig I plugged it into (in this case, a Fender Champ 600 and a Squire Jazzmaster).\n\nTo me, Fender style guitars and pickups have a tendency to sound a bit thin played through distortion pedals and solid state amps. Pickups like P-90's are a bit better for this, but for the best sound, a hum canceling pickup like the Gibson PAF (insert your own favorite here) works best when playing with distortion, so in my opinion, if you have a solid state amp you will want to put some thought into what guitar and pedal you want to use with it (assuming you have a selection of them, like I do), or, to put it another way, if you only have one guitar (and know how to use it!) you may want to put a little more thought into your amp when pairing it with your guitar of choice. I say this because I have seen a lot of young players who buy gear based more on their budget than with an eye to getting the sound they want.\n\nThat said, depending on what you ended up with, this pedal may not work for you. On the other hand, as someone noted, if you have a tube amp, or, as I said above, a Gibson or Epiphone style guitar you might like the sound of this one.\n\nI thought the pedal was a fair approximation of an overdriven tube sound (again, when used with a tube amp!) but keep in mind that comparisons like this never survive side by side comparisons (I mean, really, combo modeling amps don't REALLY sound like a Marshall stack when played next to a Marshall stack) so when I say it approximates an overdriven tube sound, that's as accurate as I can be about it - it sounds enough like an overdriven tube amp to my ear that I am happy with it. Your results may vary. One thing for sure is that the price is hard to beat, and as others have noted, Boss sound effects pedals will last long after you have gotten tired of them and sold them at the garage sale.\n\nComparisons with other pedals, whether more or less expensive, are really of no value, this is going to be YOUR pedal, and it's what you think that matters. If possible, try a friend's, or go to a music store and try it first, although if it was me I would just buy the pedal there after having tried it.\n\nThat said, if you have a tube amp or play guitars with humbucking style pickups through decent solid state amps, you may like it. If anybody says anything, just tell them an old fart on the internet who has played through just about everything said so. And remember: 90% of happiness in life is the ability to manage your expectations."

To try using it the way it is would damage the finish on the guitar, and I don't have time to return it, so I have to go down to the hobby shop, buy some cork, and make a cork cushion to replace the one that should have come with it. I have read other reviews where buyers are talking about missing screws, this is just sloppy quality control. It's really irritating to buy something you need and having to fix it before you can use it.\n\nUpdate: I got the cork and the Super Glue and placed the cork cushion where it should have been and finally put the pickup in the guitar.\n\nIt's hard to balance the strings with this pickup compared to the preamp version, some fiddling with the tone controls and compression helps a lot. Not bad, not great, but it will suffice for now. Worth the money, that's about all, it's no bargain."

I order a lot via mail-order, and it's the bane of my existence, since its painfully obvious inability to protect anything is the #1 reason for shipping damage. Yet I can't hold Gator accountable here, since polystyrene is the de facto standard support material--even in expensive guitar cases.]\n\nThe case has a major flaw: it doesn't include recesses for the strap buttons. Therefore the neck sticks up in the air when a SG is placed in the case, and closing the case puts pressure on the neck.\n\nThose of you who own classic Gibson guitars sound off here.

In my experience so far it is easier to extract good sound from drums with individual mics rather than trying to capture multiple items with a single mic.  On the other hand, I see (hear) no need to have individual mics for hi-hat and other cymbals when I use two PG81 condenser mics overhead.  The supplied cable with PG56-XLR is only 15 ft long, which even in my small setup is too short (need 25 ft), so opted for the -LC version.  These mics sound awesome, very warm and clean. The PG56s are super directional and pickup almost nothing from other drums when mounted on the supplied A50D rim mounts and pointed towards the drum head. Note that the current amazon description for PG56-LC omits the fact that an A50D rim mount is included in each PG56-LC package (I have submitted a modification request for the description that corrects this omission).  These rim mounts are just perfect for the PG56s, just mount and forget. I run all the mics into a Behringer XENYX 2442 mixer with USB interface, which I run into Studio Mini XL app on my iPad via iPad camera kit USB adapter. Still experimenting with all this but so far I have been very happy with the results."

The taper of the pots used are such that there is a very rapid shift from one signal to the other when used in pan mode. This means that I can not get a gradual shift from one to the other, as soon as I begin to move the pedal a little from one amp to the other there is a HUGE change in volume. This makes it very touchy and pretty much useless for trying to add a little crunch to my rhythm sound.\n\nI do use it for panning from one amp to the other when I switch amps for leads because it does this move without any clicks or pops. If move it fast you don't hear the ramp up in volume as it moves from one amp to the other.\n\nI would not buy this again for my application. It's expensive. It is very heavy duty in the way it feels but I'm just not very satisfied by the way it works for my application.

There are 2 things I don't like about this double pedal, and I would've returned it if I was wise enough at the time before the return policy was still good.\n\nOne: the plastic beaters are WAY too heavy, they throw me off too much, cause a ton of fatigue and slow me down. I of course knew that the beaters were solid plastic, but the sound they make- makes not want to play them very much. They have a seriously loud attack that makes my bass drum sound like a loud BAM! noise. I can change my drumhead or what ever, but I'd prefer if it came with lighter felt beaters or double siders. My fault I suppose...\n\nTwo: I don't like the fact that it requires a drum key to attach the pedal to the bass drum hoop, there is as tiny latch under the main pedal that holds the key safely which I think is pretty convenient, but doesn't help if you some how loose the key and are forced to take drastic measures into removing the pedal off the hoop.\n\nIt's not a bad pedal, I just would've preferred something not as heavy or hard on the feet.\nIt sturdy as hell and seems reliable enough to stand up to any kind of music.\nBut even though, being new to double bass, it feels a little awkward and more difficult to play compared to other pedals I've tested, even to the 402 single chain version."

Installation was fast, and only took a couple of minutes.  My problems with it are 3 fold:  #1.  Sounds just a bit \"tinny\" = too much on the high end, and not an equal amount of bass.  #2.  A small complaint is that you have to dismantle the entire installation just to change the batteries, and I couldn't get mine to work in \"passive\" mode.  #3.  And the biggest complaint, is that the volume control is difficult to get to when you're performing on stage.  You have to stick your finger in the hole on the top side of the strings and fumble around trying to change the volume which is very sensitive so all of sudden you can be too loud or too soft.  Like I said, it is not a bad product, just not top notch, and definitely not for professionals.  If you're just fooling around at home, or recording at home, it is fine, and will do the job for you.  BUT!!!  If you're a pro, you'll want to spend double the money and get an L. R. Baggs M-80.  The M-80 gives you the truest sound (unbelievable), works in passive mode, and is very easy to change the volume control.  Sincerely, Doc"

I installed them in a Maple fretboard Jimmie Vaughan model Fender Stratocaster. I never really 'disliked' them, but I never really fell in love with them either. I'm running my guitar thru a Fender Mustang 3 amp and sometimes a Vox VT20. The tone was just ALWAYS too 'harsh' for me. Seemed to always be breaking up, even at low volume. Turn up volume on guitar, breaking up. Turn up volume on amp, breaking up. Not in a good way. In a \"wow that sounds like crap\" way. In a really crinkling up aluminum foil type way. While the articulation is there, the shrill'ness just bothered the s outta me. As far as the tone, me personally, I never felt I achieved the SRV tone I was searching for. I recently swapped these out for Dimarzio pickups, an Area 58' in the neck, a True Velvet in the mid, and an Area 61' in the neck. This combination to me sounds a LOT more authentic and clean. The articulation is there, the clarity is there, and just the overall 'roundness' is there for me.\nConclusion, after a YEAR of use, to me Texas Specials didn't hit the mark for Texas Blues or any blues for that matter. The only Blues I got was from spending $199.\nI don't know how these sound in a pure tube amplifier, so maybe that's where all the positive reviews come from. So good luck!"

You would have to compliment the mic with many other products like a studio quality mixer, speakers and so on. If you are a home or hobby user, then go for this mic. This mic is quite good for its price. I would probably say, it exceeds your expectations.\n\nArrived as promised in a frustration free packing.

This instrument feels quite light for its size yet the neck feels very solid with a large round shape to it. I never expect an instrument to be playable out of the box and, sure enough, I had to loosen up the truss rod (with the included Allen wrench).\n\nI'm not sure if the strings it came with were Rotosound or ordinary phosphor-bronze, but that's not the sound I'm after. I agree with another reviewer who opted for flatwound strings (which are hard to find for acoustics, but a set of Fender electrics, 9050M's, gave it a kind of smooth, \"upright-like\" tone once you find the right touch. I mentioned the truss rod and, to be honest, the neck has a bit of a hump on the high string side, resulting in some buzzing on the G and D strings around the 9th-10th frets. I'm still in the setup stage and I like to tinker so I hope to tweak the saddle and nut and possible shave the frets/fingerboard if I can't get rid of that buzz.\n\nCosmetically, the satin finish and detail are very impressive. For this price I expect imperfections and there is a dark blemish on the soundboard where a tiny bit of what I suspect is painted-on purfling bled, possibly while the finish was being sprayed (it is a Chinese-made instrument and I've seen it on cheap violins).  There's also a tiny half-grain-of-rice-sized chip in the neck finish that I hope a furniture pen and a little lacquer will take care of.\n\nOther than that, it looks great, plays well and has a nice woody tone. If I saw this instrument \"on the rack\" I would have guessed it was at least twice the price if not more. I haven't even tried the electronics; I bought it to record acoustically and use my electric for amp-time."

One feature it has (which is not mentioned in the manual) is the ability to type in a tempo via the numbered pads. That is very useful for changing tempos rapidly on stage. The manual only lists two ways to change tempo - the dial and tap tempo function. Programming some functions such as changing the individual volumes of drums and cymbals can be very difficult to understand thanks to what I consider a poorly written manual. Where I have succeeded doing this seems to be by accident, and of course, it's difficult to remember what actually worked.\nThe back lighted display is very helpful, although some of the buttons are difficult to read when not in good lighting.

Anyway, I've put it through the H E double hockey sticks of a few bands, thrown it around stages, spilled beer in it, even left it in the rain... Still works! It never really sounded all that good to begin with (a bit less clear, more muffled than a SM 58) but it's always had a place in my gear box as a backup. I've used it on vocals and acoustic guitar, banjo and a cabinet or two, and it worked fine for all those things. Not amazing, but ok.\n\nIf you're looking for a good, cheap SM 58 style mic, I'd go with the Behringer 5800. Great mic, sounds really good, costs like twenty bucks. Still not as good as a Shure SM, but you can get four or five for the same price, and I've used those for years as well with pretty good luck, especially on vocals. Even recorded a whole album with them. I wouldn't do it again, but for live vocals in most rooms no one is ever going to know the difference."

But the DM80 is, and I know this sounds weird, fantastic for live vocals. I randomly tried it one night at a bar gig in an impossibly muddy-sounding room where even my Shure Beta 57 wasn't cutting through on vocals, and it instantly stood out. You have to scoop the mids and boost the highs a bit (but not as much as you'd think) and suddenly the average male tenor voice just jumps out. The mic also defies proximity effect and has a pretty wide on-axis pickup pattern, which is great for singing with your eyes shut (singers tend to wander from the mic when they do this) and for vocalists who think it's sexy to get their lips all up in the grill, which usually makes a 58-style mic go boomy. I got a lot of weird looks from people in the audience who know vocal mics, but I also got a lot of compliments on how present the vocals were in a room that is notorious for being terrible for understanding lyrics.\nThis mic also shines on upright bass- you have to use a LOT of gain, but with a nice preamp and some compression (I use a UA LA610) you can get a killer tone by placing the DM80 just to the right (facing the bass) of the bridge at the very top of the F-hole, and close in to the body. This is very nice for recording upright live in a room with other instruments because the null of the dynamic DM80 rejects outside noise nicely, and the lack of proximity boominess allows the mic to capture the \"wood\" tones of the bass without too much mud.\n\nI realize that this review is not really that helpful if you're just looking for drum mics, but the DM80 is a workhorse that will always be in my bag. I wish Nady still sold them separately!"

I can say that it appears to be a fantastic material for a nut, and it is easily worked and shaped, and I look forward to getting one that fits.  The downside for me was that this nut, which was supposed to fit my Epiphone Les Paul, doesn't.  It turns out that in the 2014 year production run, they changed the nut height on the Traditional Pro and probably a couple of other models.  The end result is that it doesn't fit, it's a little too short.  It can't really be shimmed either, so getting a taller one is my only alternative, since I don't want to make one from scratch.  I would advise you to measure carefully before ordering, as they are close, but not the same.\n\nThe good thing is that Graphtech has good customer support.  They said they'd send me a replacement when the correct one comes out (they said they were aiming for Spring 2016)."

        "reviewText": "A friend showed up at our monthly guitar club meeting with this and I loved having an on/off switch right at my fingertips. Genius!\nI bought 2 immediately. The shorter one goes from my guitar to the pedal board and the longer one from the pedal board to the amp. Works like a charm and no excuse now for damaging amps or ears.\n\nTwo issues to consider. The right angle plug was a mm or 2 short of being able to stick into my Tele and my Takamine. It would not seat properly and would slide out. I had to turn the cord around and use the right angle on the pedal board side, where it worked, but now the switch is \"down there\". I don't think Planet Waves is the first connector that I had a problem with that so I don't blame them, but maybe stick with the straight jack if you are not sure. Second issue is simply that these little button-switches are fussy. You have to make sure you have it in the right position by looking at them - feel won't do. (If you see the white edge they are \"quiet\")"

While they do produce more sound as an acoustic instrument (a good, pleasing sound), I apparently lack the strength to play medium gauge strings.  I did verify that the truss rod has the guitar neck straight.  After 1 week and at least 15 hours of play, I can not cut it with these strings.  Another friend, professional guitar player and luthier had recommended against the medium gauge strings but did I listen?  Going back to light weight Elixirs.  Through my amplifier, light or medium gauge strings make only a slight difference.  For whatever it's worth..."

The knob on mine won't turn to any setting other than 100bpm.  Other than that it seems okay.  It produces a tone at A440, clicks off 100 bpm or blinks a light at 100 bpm.  Does seem strange, since it's sold as a metronome, that no other tempo can be selected.  Short of that it works.\n  So, since I didn't have anything invested, I took it completely apart.  Battery out, circuit board out, arrow display decal glued to the center of the knob and sure enough, it is one molded piece with no ability to turn, EVER! I even took to it with a pair of pliers to be sure.  It's just a pretty picture that gives you the impression of select-ability. I'd be skeptical of any of their products now.\n\nSo I stand corrected.  It isn't a knob.  The arrows are buttons which you push to go up or down in tempo.  Sorry"

They sit nicely on it, mostly supported by the neck, but the legs offer the base of your guitar something to lean on as well, meaning its not as much tension as a normal neck-support stand.  And that's probably good."
